* FRONT MATTER

  The first time John Sharp found out that he could transform into a bear, and could speak the language of bears, was sometime after his twelfth birthday.

  It seemed so long ago that he had first journeyed to the Realm of the White Bear with his good friend Glynis McGinty, there to encounter the raven Meldrake, along with the gruff farmer of cows and numbers called Kell, and the mysterious king and queen of lesser birdkind, Starling and Silverbird. And in fact it was.

  His travels with Glynis and Meldrake had come to an end at the hands of Vellus the Verse Badger and his cohorts, who had stolen him away from his friends in order to deliver him to that strange avian creature known as Redcloth, who is often called simply ``The Adversary", at least in that far-away place.

  Meanwhile, Glynis has much yet to learn of magic, and of the ways of Number and Verse in particular. This tale begins for her in the house of Meldrake, which is also called the Ravenslair, where she will begin preparing for a journey the likes of which perhaps only Meldrake, alone among all living creatures, has taken before, in the strange days before he became Meldrake. Drawn inexorably to the Dark Tower, the pair will nevertheless encounter a surprise or three along the way.

  And of course, Dear Reader, you know what they say about the best-laid plans of mice and men -- it turns out that this saying applies to the plans of big sisters, too. Especially where little sisters are concerned . . .

* INVOCATION

#+begin_verse
Breath of jelec, breath of cold
Cov'ring the land in days of old
Cov'ring all in snow and white
Frozen stars in the frozen night
Where the lights would shine in colors many
And the sky, alight, revealed the en'my.
For all was nearly lost, or worse
When the Protector laid down his awesome curse
That some should speak, and some only listen
And the first one asked, warum wir wissen?
Through that speech, he aligned the horde
Bears, eagles, and wolves, all swords
To stab at the black ones, the hearts of iron
We drove them back once, blood afire
To the precipice from whence they came
And they left this place, but not the same
For as a vessel, cracked, lets in the light
They changed us when they taught us the meaning of fright.

Frozen stars in the frozen night
Frozen stars in the frozen night

* HALFMOON

``What's your name?" The badger was asking John for his name again, snarling it, really. In fact, several of these unhappy badgers surrounded John at the moment, though it was only the largest and fiercest which spoke. The rest seemed content to merely wait for John's answer.

While contemplating exactly what sort of answer he'd like to give, it occurred to John Sharp that badgers were in fact rather frightening creatures. Sharp claws and razor teeth were in evidence, as was the sheer size of them. The badgers in question were all as tall as John himself, with the exceptions of his sole interrogator, who was even taller.

These badgers had arrived shortly after Meldrake's verse incantation had knocked Glynis, John, and the first badger they'd encountered (the one who had studied Verse) to the ground. The hawk had not fallen as a result of Meldrake's incantation, however, and John had been amazed at how quickly things had happened after that. Meldrake had taken to the sky with the hawk in hot pursuit close behind. After a moment's recuperation, Glynis had regained her feet and transformed to the Whitehawk right before his eyes, to John's amazement. Though he had seen it already, he was by no means used to it yet: the sight of his friend's fingers stretching towards the sky, becoming longer and thinner; her chin receding, shrinking away as her nose grew, and grew some more, and acquired a sharp, hooked point; feathers sprouting from her skin like plants from a garden's soil, covering her fair skin; her hazel eyes shrinking into amber stones, the eyes of a hawk; these and other things did he see. It was in fact quite a lot for a young mind to handle. Perhaps it was /only/ for a young mind to handle...

``Damn your name, then!" cursed the badger casually as he turned to his fellows. ``Go on, grab him, then!" And back to John: ``It's alright, you won't need a name where you're heading, youngster. This one's going to headquarters, `` he added for the others there, and it seemed to John Sharp that the others nodded knowingly, including the Verse Badger (as John had taken to calling him in his own private speech). The Verse Badger, as it turned out, was smaller than the others here, lighter in color, and observedly less fierce. In fact, he had been pushed to the outer edge of the circle which surrounded John at the moment; clearly, he was a youngster or small for his age -- it did not matter which, really.

``Sir, what does headquarters want with this creature? With respect, of course . . ." Thus came a question from the Verse Badger himself, the effect being that of a disembodied voice emerging from behind a wall, in this case the wall of badger flesh and fur in front of him.

``Never you mind, poet," replied the largest badger (whom John had taken to thinking of as ``Big Boy" --how quickly we seek out names for people, places and things!) to the smallest. ``It's well above your pay grade. Perhaps you'd do better to mind your own business: books about poetry and feelings and such," he added.

This last brought a round of laughter and derision from the rest of the group. ``Poetry," said one with a snort of disgust.

``Very well, sir," replied the smallest badger. The words themselves were respectful, but John thought he detected a hint of petulance in the tone. ``Not surprising, really," he thought. ``It's no way to treat one of your own fellows, not if you want to get anything worthwhile out of him." And then: ``I wonder if this is the infamous Holcredt Consortium?  Would explain all the funny armbands. I wonder what the point of it all is."

``Enough talk. On to Halfmoon!" Thus ended John's little reverie with Big Boy's orders, which of course meant that John was meant to be roughly grabbed and shoved into some position, configuration, etc. for the journey.

``Second," said Big Boy to another of the badgers there, a rather dark one with rough fur, ``take this prisoner and another badger and make for Halfmoon, post-haste. You'll probably have to carry him. From what I remember these two-legged creatures are not much for speed. The rest of you, with me!" And with that, he and the rest of the badger cohort headed North, in the direction which John and company had come from. John noted that the Verse Badger had been the one selected by this `Second.'

Presumably, the others were off in search of Meldrake and Glynis, or some signs thereof. John thought it was unlikely that they could do too much to help in a search for birds in flight, and so decided they were probably a general patrol of some kind, though he couldn't really see the point.

``Come on, then," said the Verse Badger to John after the larger group had left. ``Let's go to Halfmoon. It's a lovely town, really, perched right on the Long River, it is. Got its own bridge, too, and all sorts of folk coming and going from the docks. Might be you'll like it."  John was surprised to see that the other badger did not rebuke or scold the smaller one, but merely laughed. ``Alright, little brother, let's go; you can bring your new pet," said the large, dark one called `Second.'  The badgers had a good chuckle at that, and a true chuckle it was, all good nature and mirth. It seemed that the malice had left their little group along with Big Boy.

Seeing this, John was emboldened enough to ask, ``What's in Halfmoon? Is that where headquarters is?" and then: ``Couldn't I just go back to my friends?"

``No, I'm afraid you can't go back to your friends. Likely you couldn't find them anyway; they've flown off, and you're stuck here on the ground, like us. As far as Halfmoon goes, it's a pretty little river town, but it's not where Headquarters is. That'd be long leagues south, so you're in for a hike," said the Verse Badger.

``Will you be bringing me there?" asked John.

``Looks that way. I've always wanted to see this HQ anyway," said VB, and his brother nodded.

There wasn't much else to say at that point, and John Sharp was never one for saying much else anyway, and so the three of them continued along the winding path along Long River's edge, leaving the deep forest further behind. John could still see the edge of that same forest creeping to the edge of the fields some good ways away to the east, as if it were following alongside him, which was comforting in its way. John had always been a creature of forest rather than field, and found his solitude there alongside his joy. Open fields and farms were pretty enough, but in the end it was the trees he loved, the dark evergreens especially and most of all.

The path continued South, wending its way around large oaks and maples that grew along the river. Whether they'd been planted by wind and chance or by some long-ago wise farmers, John couldn't tell. In either case, they served as a nice windbreak, in addition to holding the soil along the riverbank together. They were a hedge against erosion by wind or water, and judging by the condition of these farmers' fields, they'd done their work well. The soil had changed from an acidic, sandy grit inside the evergreen forest into a somewhat darker brown as they'd travelled south. The soil upon which they walked was apparently suited for apple trees, corn, and perhaps some wheat, at least as far as John could identify wheat. It was definitely something from the wheat family, though.

Finally the cultivated fields began to give way to small groups of cottages here and there as they passed. Most were made of whitewashed stone and mortar, with green shutters and thatched roofs. Gardens there were, fenced in from the animals of the forest and field, filled with vegetables that John was pretty sure he'd recognize from his own life. Maybe not, though. Even so, the sight of cottage and garden cheered him, as it always had. ``Maybe this won't be so bad. I'll make the trip to this `Headquarters' with these badgers, and I'll have a bit of adventure. Then I'll go looking for Glynis and Meldrake. If anything, I'm easier for them to find than they are for me. They can fly up on me at any moment as I'm walking along, so I'll let them do just that. Until then, why not explore a bit?" Bold thoughts from a twelve-year-old, but then, perhaps not. Who can remember their twelve-year-old self, and how brave that person was, compared to what they are now? It was the same with John.

As they'd come South, the river had grown wider and deeper. The cottages in the fields to their left grew larger and more numerous, and finally they saw it: a stone wall which could only have been Halfmoon. It was probably fifteen feet high, with a wooden door reinforced by iron, and the path upon which they stood ended abruptly there. To the right, they could see the bridge stretching across the river, though it was some ways downriver from the wall. Where the bridge met the river's opposite bank, there was a stone tower. Presumably it defended the bridge from, well, whatever it is that towers are meant to defend one from.

``Who goes there?" A voice from a slit above the door had the temerity to ask.

#+begin_verse
/Why, 'tis I, the Badger of the Sunlit Field!/
/And I might command this door to Yield!/
/Were I you, And on the Other Side/
/I'd set aside my Foolish Pride/
/Open for a pair of Halfmoon's sons/
/Returned from the Forest with a Stranger One/
/Than even you have seen, good Sir!/
/Arise! Unlock! Awake! Bestir!/
#+end_verse

Thus did the Verse Badger gain their entry to Halfmoon. Oaken door groaned open, and John and his captor-companions strolled in. The wall through which they walked was several feet thick, and above their heads John saw some trapdoors. ``What are those, I wonder?" asked the young man from Lake William. ``Why, they're holes from which to dump boiling oil, the better to scald the hides from our flesh," came the Verse Badger's casual reply.

``Oh. That's nice," replied John.

``Nice if you're from Halfmoon, of course," offered Verse Badger. ``And how shall we address you, Sir? Give us any name you please, for how else shalt a Badger tease?" John was beginning to like this fellow, in a strange, you've-captured-me-but-at-least-it's-rather-jolly-and-interesting-so-far sort of way.

``And why should I give you my name, after you were shooting those needles at my friends?"

``Oh, that foolishness? That was just for show! That fat old badger is so serious, so we give him a hearty `Yes, sir!' and put on a good show of it now and then, but that's all it is, just a bit of fun, really. Why, not one badger in that group wants anything to do with hurting anyone. It just makes the old coot feel better to have some young ones to order around, marching up hill and down dale, all in a day's work, you know. The old fellow would have nothing to do all day without his patrols. Never mind the fact that there's nothing that needs patrolling against!"

``Oh no! We're surrounded by corn and vegetable gardens! Oak trees, and trout! Which of them will attack us first?" wondered the one called Second. It was the first time John had heard him speak.

``You still haven't answered my question." John was determined to get an answer, however flippant.

``We weren't even aiming at them! That's what I'm trying to tell you! Halfmoon has been at peace for hundreds of years. There's no reason for all this belligerence. It's ever since the old man got involved with this HOLCREDT business, I'm afraid. Those fools see threats in every shadow; thankfully, there aren't many of them. Just another group of folk with nothing better to do. Everyone needs a hobby, you know." And with that the Badger winked at John, or at least John would have sworn he did. Who's had a badger wink at them before? And how would you prove it?

John decided to let his frosty reserve melt just a bit. The Verse Badger's words had the ring of truth to them, since there was so little guile in them. He also laughed too much, and his laughter was all mirth and no cruelty. John decided he believed him. ``You can call me `Ursus,' if you please. And how should I address you?"

``I am known as Vellus to most, so you may call me that. Don't think you've won anything through a name, however. This is but the outermost ring of my powers, if you catch my meaning."

John did not, or not really, at least. He only knew what Meldrake had told him: don't give anyone your true name.

``Ursus is the bear. Are you a bear? I know a few, and they are not so small as you. They smell worse, and their claws are deadlier. Perhaps you'd like to meet one of them?" Vellus the Verse Badger was nothing if not accomodating, anyone could see that.

Just then they emerged from the tunnel through the wall into the sunlight. What John saw was a delight. Cobbled streets lined with trees, and all manner of strange creature and folk to stroll them! The main street of Halfmoon was much like those that John knew back in that other place that he called home, which is to say, Lake William. Of course, it wasn't Lake William, anyone could see that, or even a mirror of Lake William. In any case, the buildings ran alongside the street, several stories tall. Sidewalks ran in front of them, and trees planted every so often gave them shade. Shops and (presumably) restaurants filled the ground floors of the buildings -- some of them even had signs John thought he could almost read! They were written in a queer language whose letters resembled English, but of course it wasn't English, not really. After trying to read the signs for a moment and realizing he was lost, John gave up. Better to take in the rest of the scene.

As noted above, there were creatures and folk going about their daily business along those tree-lined sidewalks. And the streets! Filled with carts, and creatures darting between them to cross the street (no crosswalks here, John noted), the street was crowded with carts of all shapes and sizes. Presumably they were delivering to and from Halfmoon all sorts of victuals, vittles, trinkets, magical amulets, books, produce, meat, spices, salt, and more. John could smell some of those things as he stood, dumbfounded, with the badgers at his side.

Many of the carts were being pulled by oxen, just as one might imagine; John was surprised (though he shouldn't have been by now) to hear them talking to each other, and their drivers! ``But of course," he thought, ``Why shouldn't the oxen talk? Everyone and everything else does! I suppose the trees will be talking next, we haven't heard from them yet."

Little did Young John Sharp know as he spoke those words.

``Come now! Wake up, look lively! We're off to see a friend of mine, and maybe ours." Vellus had let John look long enough, and standing in one place when one is in a bustling town just won't do. ``We'll see if you still want that name of yours in a bit," added the badger with a toothy grin. It made John a little uneasy, since (good-natured or no) a lot of sharp teeth were visible when Vellus grinned, and even though badgers didn't eat humans so far as John knew, sharp teeth on a creature that size will tend to make one a bit uneasy.

Second might have sensed that uneasiness. ``Don't worry, lad, where we're going it's perfectly safe, even for hairless creatures with no teeth like yourself. Meaning no offense, of course," he added. ``It's just that we haven't often seen your like in the Realm. Most everyone here is a creature of land, air, or sea, with the appropriate fur, feathers, claws, beaks, horns, etc. So you can imagine we find it a little curious how you lot could defend yourselves, survive."

It was obvious to John that Second had never visited the world of Men.

And so they set off on a little journey through the streets of Halfmoon, with Vellus in front, Second bringing up the rear, and poor John trying to keep pace as he was jostled between. The brisk pace meant that John experienced the next part of his time in Halfmoon as a bit of a blur. More tree-lined, cobbled streets, more creatures filling them, more signs in that queer ``almost-but-not-quite-English" that made his head swim. Turn left, turn right, walk briskly to corner, turn left again. These were as many words as Vellus uttered, muttering as he glanced back and forth between the street and a scrap of paper (or what passed for it), all at a brisk march. It seemed that he'd been given directions by this ``friend," and they were all three of them at the mercy of that slip of paper, or so John thought.

And just when John had begun to tire of yet another street, yet another line of oxcarts, crowds, not-English signs, and the like, Vellus drew to a halt. This meant, of course, that John ran squarely into the back of him, since he was in the midst of walking just as fast as his (admittedly) rather short legs would let him. John thought it was rather like walking into a wall (a fur-covered wall, that is).

They found themselves at the edge of a queer sort of park. Open fields skirted the front edge of it, where the sidewalk ran along the street, which acted as a buffer of open space between the busy streets and the woods of the park itself. Of course, John had no way of knowing that it was a park, or if it was, but what else could it be? One can only interpret new information in terms of what is already understood, and so he understood it as a city park.

``This looks like a park. Reminds me of the park back home in Lake William," John managed to get out (after having recovered from his impact with the fur-covered wall that was Vellus, of course).

``'Park,' eh? Well, here we'd call it a smallwood. Though it probably amounts to the same thing," replied Vellus.

``Wait a minute. Why did you need that piece of paper with directions to find it? I thought you were from around here," said John Sharp.

Vellus and Second looked at each other.

``Smallwoods have a way of moving about a place, didn't you know that? Or do all your 'Parks' just stay in one place?" asked the Verse Badger.

John didn't know what to make of it, so he remained silent.

Vellus replied to his silence with a nod. ``In any case, we've arrived. Our guide resides within, and here we are without! Let's march ourselves up to the gate, and give the fool a shout!" It seemed that he was in the mood for some rhyming again.

They left the sidewalk and continued up a footpath lined with uneven stones. As they crossed the field and came closer to the `smallwood,' John could see that there was a wooden gate across the path where it entered the wood. ``Is there nothing in this place," John thought to himself, ``but that it doesn't have a gate of some sort in front of it?" He thought it best not to share such questions, of course.

As they approached the gate, John could see that it was set in an arch, also of wood, carved with strange letters that he didn't understand. They were different from the ``not-English" of the signs in the town, though. In addition to letters, there were other carvings, lining the arch and the edges of the door in what we would describe as a `knotwork' pattern. The surfaces of the door itself were both carved and painted, and depicted scenes of small, dark creatures engaged in various activities. Or so one imagined, from a distance of twenty yards.

The images grew clearer as they made their way closer. ``Bears!" thought John. ``Bears!" Realizing what was carved on those doors, he was both excited and afraid. Each door was carved with three scenes, arranged vertically. The lower panel showed what were obviously cubs, little roly-poly creatures all in a pile, wrestling around as cubs are no doubt wont to do, and all the while Mother looked on from not-far-away. John thought that she was probably enjoying the play of the cubs, but there was also a note of defending them there, a fierceness that said: ``Come no closer."

The second, middle panel showed a great tree, and in the high central branches of that tree was a bear, presumably there to gather whatever fruit or honey from beehives had drawn him or her there. The picture was an amazement to John, for although he knew from reading books that bears could climb trees, he had never seen any pictures of such things, much less seen it in life. And yet here it was, carved in relief and painted, a bear clambering around in the upper branches of a high tree! Rather exciting stuff...

The third and highest panel John saw last. Since the gate was so tall, let's say eight feet or more by our measure, his eyes fell naturally to the bottom panel, and then rose to the center. But now, having seen those lower panels, he turned his eyes to the highest panel of the carved wooden door, and what did he see there? Why, only this:

Two huge bears faced off against each other. Clearly a fight or contest of some sort was about to take place. Between the two bears stood a massive, gnarled tree, the branches of which filled the sky of the carving and, in fact, covered it completely. Beneath its massive span and thick trunk, the bears beneath looked rather small, though John had no doubt that, were he to see two such bears in person, preparing for combat, he'd be quite afraid. Which was no doubt what he should be feeling right now, approaching the lair of what was apparently a bear or group of bears, right here in the middle of a bustling town. And from the looks of things, they didn't really want visitors.

Even the loquacious Vellus, the Badger of Verse himself, seemed somewhat cowed (or was it awed?) as they approached the high oaken gates. Second, usually not one to say much, kept his own counsel as usual. As did John. Vellus merely turned to John, and said quietly (if rather sharply), ``Mind your tongue here, as I will mine. Friends or no, they can be fierce!" And with that, fear or no, caution or no, the Verse Badger drew himself up to his full height, steel in his spine, and raised the brass knocker that hung from the heavy gate. One, two, three times he knocked. The sound the knocker made as it struck the brass plate behind it rang across the field over which they'd walked. It seemed to affect the dark forest ahead queerly, however, and John could have sworn the sound didn't travel more than ten feet or so before failing.

The sound of that knocker's ring could have lost its courage, after all. Upon entering *that* forest, filled with *those* creatures, one could hardly be blamed for losing heart. Even if one were an inanimate wave of sound. For the bears were widely known in the Realm, and feared, not because they were killers, per sÃ©, or particularly vicious (certainly they were no more bloodthirsty than the birds of prey, or vicious than an aroused badger, for example), but because of their sheer greatness of size, and also, one must imagine, because of how terrible a creature of that size can become when aroused to anger. For size does matter, in some things, and the rage of a giant beast must exact its own terrible price on those within reach when that rage comes.

Perhaps more unsettling to the other creatures of the realm was that there was no way to determine when a bear might attack. In some cases it was largely a matter of the bear's personality and personal inclination, and thus there was no way to predict it. This is not to say that all creatures in the Protector's Realm did not have their own personalities, thoughts, and feelings, for of course they did, and to claim otherwise would be folly. Even so, the bear was known as a creature of strange moods rather than predatory impulses, and most thought it the better part of wisdom to simply stay away. For what reason would a badger have to consort with bears? Or a raven, for that matter, or a starling or rabbit or wolf? Of all these, the wolves were the only land animals that did not fear the bears, which is to say: would engage in battle with them from time to time, usually over a freshly killed carcass. We might style it more neutrally as a `confrontation', though for a wolf it is more akin to a battle than a hunt, when dealing with a creature such as a bear.

Then there was the matter of the smallwoods, which is to say: Magic. For the smallwoods were forests that *moved*, and travelled from place to place throughout a city or town. They were known as the only way for bearkind to enter or leave a town, or at least: the only way they *would* enter or leave. And how could a forest move from one place to another, you ask? How could it travel from town to town, or (as also happened) from one place within a town to another, and all this without the town's residents seeing or hearing a thing, waking up on Thursday and finding that Wednesday's forest in the park on the south edge of town had become Thursday's forest on the north end? We simply don't know, as they don't, and there are some such things that we cannot know, the mysteries of bears perhaps being one of those mysteries among many that the universe holds. Or perhaps not, and one day we'll know how it's done, see the gears and nuts and bolts of it, so to speak, and say: ``Oh, we knew it all along! No Magic about it!" All very easy to say, of course, once we've learned how a thing is done, we who couldn't dream up how to accomplish that thing in the first place. In any event, we must call the moving forests of the bears `smallwoods', and we must admit that, for our purposes here, and according to our understanding, they are the true Magic.

None of this was on young John Sharp's mind, however, as the clang of the brass knocker at the bear's gate rang through the air. There was no other sound that John could detect, and as far as he could tell nothing was moving in forest or field. Vellus stood statue, with his brother Second beside him. They had said they had a friend here, but it was hard for John to imagine that a creature friendly to them was about to appear from behind the gate. Though John had to admit that of the scenes carved on the door, the first two had been peaceful enough, and the second one, with the bear up in the tree, could even pass for humor.

Just then they all three heard something large moving behind the gate. They could hear its breathing. A snort came, that turned into a kind of growl or throat noise. John stood stock-still and prayed (not for the first time, and not the last) that he would find a way through this, as a large body bumped against the gate from behind.

John heard the rattling of heavy chain against oak. Three seconds later, the door began to swing outward from the stone arch.

* A LADDER TO THE STARS

  ``And so it was that I found myself traveling in the company of a large raven. In fact, the raven in question was as tall as I was (which is to say: around six feet or so). He had discovered me in the dungeon of Redcloth's tower, and had brought with him, in addition to bread and water (O Joy! O Bounty!), a selection of magical items which, he assured me, would make our hasty exit possible. Naturally, I was overjoyed to hear this, since I was at that time unable to work any magics whatsoever on my own behalf. It was my hope that his large size and rather fearsome staff of ash (with its appropriately large head of meteor-rock), which he referred to as the ``Staff of Forgetting", would be adequate to secure our release.

  You can imagine my dismay upon learning that his plan for rescuing me involved, not the heavy staff with which he was armed, nor his aforementioned formidable size, but a pouch on his hip, from which he drew several scrolls of sheepskin (or a similar material, since I cannot know for sure), upon which were written mere words and symbols! Disaster! Of course, little did I know back then that these were the true tools of his trade, and more dangerous they turned out to be in the end than any longswords or warhammers. But that is a story for another time, perhaps, for in fact, the very manner of my escape was to depend upon one of these scrollmagics. For this raven and I found ourselves at the end of a long tunnel beneath the great tower. Presumably it was built for drainage, since its distinguishing characteristic was a trough, several inches deep, which ran down the center of the stone floor, creating two `lanes', as it were, and upon these we traveled. We stood there, looking out at the freedom which awaited us mere inches away... through iron bars!

  And what did this black stranger do? Did he call down the mighty powers, which I now know that he had at his command? Did he invoke some terrible spirit from beyond our little mortal coil, whose mildest wrath would tear down that dread tower, terrible as it was in its own black way, block by obsidian block? Did he conjure a $VERSEMAGIC that, in its poignance and elegance of phrase, in its bombast and gravitas, its vivacity, would rip Redcloth and all his avatars from this plane of existence with the force of seabourne gales?

  No, no, no, and no. He muttered something and pulled from the aforementioned pouch at his hip a smattering of tiny seeds, which he tossed nonchalantly onto the stones at the floor of the tunnel. He then withdrew one of the scrolls I've just told you about, and he spoke a few simple lines which, even to this day, I remember well:

#+begin_verse
/For each of you, seeds numbered 1 through n/
/Please, and Thank You, and Thank You again./
/Until you meet an obstacle, grow up straight/
/Branch left and right once you meet that gate, and/
/Naturally, branching, do the same as before/
/A tree at each tip, your roots in the floor./
#+end_verse

  With that, he reached into his pouch yet again, and brought forth a clear flask. I must assume that it was filled with water, but it was like no water which I had ever had the pleasure to see or taste, for as soon as he had sprinkled it over the seeds, he motioned for me to step back a few paces. And a good thing he did so! For no sooner had I done as he'd bid than the first shoots emerged from those seeds and began burrowing into the stones in the floor. Presumably, they wanted each to secure a proper footing before beginning their upward growth. I could hardly believe my eyes as I watched them quite literally `shoot' up from the ground and meet the iron bars, which, as it turned out, formed a portcullis. Just as the raven's verse had requested of them, the vines (as they now clearly were) grew to the first bar and branched in two, forming a `V'. Each arm of this `V' then wrapped over the bar, at which point the arms met, and each grew around the other in brief embrace, after which time they continued growing ever upward, finding a new partner with which to continue the dance at the next level. In this way they grew upward and outward, each shoot becoming vine and then thick branch, until at last they had covered the entire portcullis of iron in a sort of regular ``web" pattern or latticework.

  [Figure 13.0: FRACTAL TREE/PORTCULLIS DIAGRAM]

  At that time I began to notice a slight groaning and creaking. It was the sound something makes when it hasn't been moved from one place for a very long time. For the branches of the raven's few seeds had reached their full growth and strength, and now they began to push implacably against the weight of the portcullis. It began to move upward, so slowly that it was almost imperceptible to the eye.

  Now, I must admit that I began to feel some anxiety at that point, since I was, in fact, still technically a prisoner of Redcloth's dread tower, and on that count very little of substance had changed, since I had not even got out the basement door yet! And so, unselfish fellow that I am, I turned and shared these feelings with my new friend and would-be rescuer. ``Friend", I said, ``you've done lots for me so far, and I am of course very grateful, but I remain troubled since, for all your work, we're still in the basement of the same tower in which I woke up this morning, and not very many steps away from the cell where I slept, as it happens. I've no doubt that you're a brave and hearty fellow, and that, should the alarm sound and dozens of my captors come pouring out-of-doors to guard this entrance from the outside, or some such, you would do your bravest best, but 'twould avail us little, as I think you know".

  And so he turned to me and said, ``All that you've said is true, but in fact our true difficulty lies in front of us, not behind. For the malice of Redcloth is a subtle malice, full of tricks, traps, and puzzles. I've no doubt this simple business with the portcullis will be looked back upon with a fond nostalgia once we've seen what awaits us beyond these walls".

  ``And yet you don't seem to be in any particular hurry", I replied. ``Why is that? Aren't there going to be guards coming? One might imagine that a tower this size has many and more. Yet you don't seem concerned at all."

  ``Mere guards are of no concern to me. Nor would they be to your captor. For he and I were trained at the same schools, by the same masters, and as such mere physical conflict, constraint, or restraint interests us little. Knowing this, he guards his tower against his real enemy, who was once a friend. For the most dangerous enemy was always once a friend. Otherwise, how could he hurt you? Only a friend would know where best to aim his sword. For that reason, I know that guards are not our challenge here. The contest is with your captor himself, and our weapon is the same as it was ever (and shall be for ever) where he is concerned: the mind. Therefore we should worry ourselves but little over guards and swords, and rather more over traps, tricks, and puzzles of logic."

  I was, to understate, quite surprised, and not entirely happy to hear this news. ``Wait. You were once friends? I don't understand. How is it that you're here to help me now? Why? What do you stand to profit from this?"

  ``Profit is of no concern to me, I have the whole world given to me. As do you, though you do not see it, friend. As for the story of my friendship with your captor, that is a long and arduous tale, with twists and turns and the love of a woman, madness, and all the ingredients which go into the cooking of such a stew. As such, we haven't time for it here."

  At that I was silent. I supposed that I would rather be rescued, and hear the tale another time (preferably in a nice warm pub, with the fire blazing and a cold pint in hand), rather than hear the tale now and thereby disrupt the rescue. I wasn't reassured, however, since the revelation that my supposed champion was in fact a friend of my (still-nearby!) captor did but little for my general sense of well-being. Not knowing this strange raven from a hole in the ground, as the saying goes, I had little reason to trust him, save for the fact that I had rotted in that cell for Protector-only-knows how long, and this creature had been the only one to care, evidenced, of course, by the fact that he was the only one who'd shown up.

  During our conversation the vines covering the portcullis had rendered it nearly invisible; in fact, it now resembled nothing so much as an ivy-covered wall, since there was not even an inch of iron visible through the now-leafy vines. Nor was any light coming through the bars. Meanwhile, the slight groaning sound the portcullis made as it was being pushed up had continued, so that there was now perhaps an inch between the floor and the bottom of the gate.

  My anxiety, as I've said before, was growing by the second, despite my new friend's reassurances, or perhaps because of them, and so I found myself staring intently at that gap, tracking its maddeningly slow progress with a watchful eye. So watchful, in fact, that the eye in question (my very own!) was beginning to twitch.

  ``Have you considered wiggling your toes?" Thus came the voice from the corner behind me. I jumped a bit at the sound, nervous thing on the verge of escape that I was, and saw the raven, now sitting on the floor. His back was against the wall, and he was smoking. In the now-mostly-dark corridor (growing lighter by the millisecond, thank The Protector!), I could see the raven's face lit by the red glow of his pipe. By this time I was tired of calling him ``the raven", and so I asked simply: ``What's your name, Friend?"

  To which he replied: ``I carry several with me at all times, for use at need. In this part of the world, I go by Meldrake. But more importantly: Have you considered wiggling your toes?"

  ``Whatever for?"

  ``Combined with a few deep breaths, I hear it's quite therapeutic. All the rage these days among the consciousness-focussed wellness troupe. You know: biofeedback, meditative states, accessing the combined genetic wisdom of millions of years of your forebears via the collective unconscious. Surely you've heard about this sort of thing?"

  I had to admit that I hadn't.

  ``No matter. You're of course free to discard or reuse my third-hand advice as you see fit. Though I, for one, recommend a good toe-wiggling from time to time."

  Though I had no idea what this character was on about, he had at least distracted me from my worries, if ever so briefly.

  ``Perhaps you'd like to have a seat with me, and watch the sunrise?" With that, he nodded towards the opposite wall, where there was now a band of light along the wall's bottom edge, where the door had allowed it in.

  I decided to sit with him and watch that ``sun" rise, and of course I wiggled my toes around some for good measure. As the good raven had implied, the tension within my feet was enormously strong, and had been causing me much pain, though I hadn't realized it before.

  We sat there for perhaps twenty minutes more, ``watching the sun rise" thanks to the work of those magnificent seeds. He with his pipe, I with my earnest toe-wiggling. And breathing, too, when I remembered to do it.

  During that time I thought about several things. First, I imagined what manner of traps and tricks lay in wait for us as we made our way past this (likely) first and easiest obstacle of our journey from the tower. Or rather, I spawned a thread of worry that ran constantly in the background and ruminated upon such topics, thereby freeing my conscious mind for more interesting (or at least useful) work.

  Second, I spent a little time thinking about what, if anything, I'd do with my life if I ever got out of here. I quickly backgrounded that process as well, attaching the label: `UNPRODUCTIVE'. You see, I have a way of thinking about my thoughts that gives me the impression that I am in control of them --or at least, I have the impression of managing them, which is comforting and even sometimes useful.

  Having sent those uninteresting topics to background processes (as noted), I brought my attention to the present. And what did I know or notice about the present, now that I had backgrounded (hereafter referred to as ``=bg='d") the usual currents of anxiety, idle future wonderings, &c.? It turned out that I knew several things:

  First: that I had just been freed from my (very small) cell by the raven with whom I now travelled, by a process that was itself duly fantastical in nature, and thus worthy of recollection for your benefit, you who are the faithful listener of this tale. Second: that cell had been hermetically sealed, i.e., had had magical protections placed upon it, in several forms, to wit:

  Verse magicks (a.k.a. ``Versorial" magic): poems and songs that, in their intent, were designed to keep me from ever leaving that room, or, barring that, would visit terrible misery upon me and mine, should I ever find a way to leave. These were placed within the walls themselves during the room's construction. More precisely: verses had been composed and transcribed onto strips of cloth, which were then baked into each individual brick laid into each wall, to include all of the floors and ceilings.

  In addition, the door to my cell was built of black oak. It is difficult for me to impute the meaning of this to you if you are not, in fact, a resident of the lands where Jelec (The Protector, Honored Be His Name) holds sway, but let it suffice to say that the black oak is a rare and beautiful tree, one that hides deep in the forest, and which has properties -- that is, ways of disguising itself from intruders. Who are these intruders? Why, creatures like us, who do all of this unnecessary moving, running around, shouting, and general noisemaking! We alternately furry or feathered oafs, alive for this fleeting moment only! Well, the black oak (and all other trees, for that matter) are highly attuned to the movements of mammals, noisy noisemakers that we are. I'm sure you don't need me to tell you that trees are quite literally ``plugged in" to the earth itself, and as such are privy to her moods and mysteries in ways that we who live a few brief years upon her surface cannot imagine.

  Finally, as you may have gathered, there are some of us here (you are among them, I think, Good Avis!) who happen to have special relationships with certain species of tree which, again for reasons which I do not understand, allows us to tap into those elemental magics to which I've just referred. The black oak is mine. As such, I could never harm it, or any door (since we are in fact discussing a door, as I recall) that is made from it. Can you harm your brother, your sister? No more could I visit harm upon my cell door. In fact, I loved that door, since I could sit in front of it for hours and just /be/. Unlike the bricks which lined my little prison, the door was not filled with any malice for me, in the form of nasty spells or otherwise. It was simply a heavy door, reinforced here and there with black iron. Black iron over black oak. Such was the cunning of my captor, for he knew this well: that the best way to imprison someone is to build part of their cage out of something they love. Never forget that.

  In any case, lest you think my imprisonment involved only the ``mere" verse magicks to which I've alluded, let me continue. For what would the world be without numbers? Those old friends of mine and yours! Yes, my adversary is exceedingly clever when it comes to the Art of Number, more so than I could ever dream of! And therein lies the other part of my prison:

  Number magicks (a.k.a. ``Mathemagics"), which take the form of various mathematical facts or puzzles, encoded in a number of ways obvious and non-. For instance, the first series of puzzles I discovered involved dyadic number sequences encoded in tilings which ran around the soffits along the ceiling. Solving these would lead to still further clues, emplaced in other areas of the room, which would lead to still further, and so on. It reminded me of the old joke about the dictionary definition of recursion:

  /Recursion/, n. See /Recursion/.

  What, you do not know what recursion is? We shall have to remedy that, my dear Avis. Yes, indeed. For now I can tell you that to recur, one must have a recurrence, that is: things happen again, and again, and again. Do you see?

  Yes, where was I? Oh yes, recursion, number magicks, &c. The walls of my cell. Dyadic and hexadic numbers were everywhere! As a matter of fact, that brings me to the nature of my escape from the outer tower, which I'll return to telling you about in a moment, if you'll but permit an old fool his ramblings. But first, what were some of the other number tricks and games in my cell? Well, I can tell you that the brick pattern on both floor and ceiling were of what I'll call the `seashell' variety; I call them that because the pattern in which they were laid resembled a seashell! Here, let me draw it for you in the dirt. Yes, over here by the fire, please. Come closer, don't be afraid. Here it is:

  [Figure 13.1: BRICKS LAID IN GOLDEN RATIO/SEASHELL PATTERN]

  So there you have it. Both floor and ceiling were laid with bricks in this way, those same malevolent bricks which were filled with spells against me. Overhead /and/ underfoot. I can't tell you how many hours, how many nights I lay awake staring at that ceiling, plumbing the depths of that pattern, of those bricks in that configuration. I spent years with them, and of course I'd like to think I got something out of it other than my current insanity, but you'll have to be the judge of that, since it's a matter for another time.

  And the walls! How could I forget the walls? When I wasn't laying awake at night staring at the ceiling, I was staring at the walls. They were laid in yet another pattern, a very fetching seven-pointed `star' pattern, as a matter of fact, and one which I'll draw for you as well, though of course you don't need me to show you what a star looks like:

  [Figure 13.2: BRICKS LAID IN STAR PATTERN]

  Even so, I suppose you must admit that this was a rather curious-looking star, and in fact it has some strange properties, this ``heptagon", as it is known.

  (Incidentally: at this point, you might be wondering why it is that our world, or reality, or realm, or branch on the great cosmic tree of life, or what-have-you (which is called the Land of the White Bear (Honored Be His Name), in case you've forgotten somehow), is filled with a people whose speech you can understand, and who use a vocabulary that is familiar to you. Indeed, why should these strange creatures from another reality be using words to describe the things in their world which are clearly based upon the English language, and which have Greek and Latin word roots, stems, suffixes, and the like? Why, the answer is simple: we are not in fact using those words, stems, suffixes, roots, and so on, based as they are upon historical events which are not of this place and of which we are nearly entirely ignorant! Instead, it is the habit of your mind to translate our speech as such, for each of us can only understand inasmuch as she can translate things happening around her into a form which is easily digestible for her own way of thinking.)

Needless to say, I was rather flattered that the dread Redcloth had had a special room built just for little old me, and that he had gone to all this trouble in general. Of course, that prospect held little real joy, since it meant that I was now trapped in a room in some drafty, cold tower, with no freedom and without even the ability to read the books I wanted, or to write or receive letters. For one who would live a life of the mind, this is ultimate damnation. At least until you realize that your mind is the book. Or alternately: books are pale shadows of mind, one mind as it existed at one moment in time.

  Returning from digression now... right. So how exactly did I escape from that horrid place? I'll tell you. Just hold in your mind that there is a version of Meldrake and one of me, sitting in that hallway or tunnel beneath the tower, idly smoking pipes and wiggling our toes, waiting for our good friends the vines to finish raising the portcullis which separates us from the outside world. Please place a mental bookmark there, since it is where we must needs return to forthwith. First, however, you must know how it is that I came to be outside my cell in the first place. And again, I must tell you: via the skill, courage and cunning of the redoubt Meldrake!

  Perhaps I praise him too much. In any case, I was, as you now know, held prisoner in that specially-constructed magical cell for time out of mind. I forgot who I was, or how long I had been there. As it happened, I was meditating upon one of the many and varied mathematical puzzles which were in evidence all around me, as was my habit, and suddenly I heard a whisper. I, who had not heard the sound of a creature's voice in --what was it? Months? Years?-- and here I was, hearing whispers. In that situation, the first thing one does is say: ``I'm probably going mad, and this is but the first step down that slope". After all, one doesn't just sit around by oneself hearing whispers all day!

  Or perhaps one does. So as I sat thinking, I heard whispers, and those whispers were difficult to hear, but I could conjecture after a few moments that they were some sort of verse. Someone was chanting a verse! At that time I had no choice but to believe that someone, some new dark sorceror who was Redcloth's favorite pet of the moment, had come down to the dungeon to have a bit of fun with me, casting a spell upon me to give me a boil upon my bottom, you know, that sort of thing. Of course, there were few but the one we call Redcloth himself who would have had the ability to do me any harm, for most of those who would call themselves ``sorceror" or ``versemaster" or ``numbermaster" were, in fact, nothing more than fools trifling with great mysteries. To be fair, those mysteries are such that few even among the wise understand. And I am by no means among the wise!

  Therefore I decided that there was little chance of some flatterer having made his way down into the bowels of the tower, and so I began to wonder: who else could it be? Over time, and by mustering intense concentration, I was able to discern but a few lines, of which I'll repeat a small part here:

#+begin_verse
/grass./
/milk./
/sour!/
/brick by brick/
/flower by flower/
/black oak, iron, parchment, power!/

/I call upon you now as the Son to his Father:/
/(mortar, stoneways, parchment, bother!)/

/Burn the Tree of Life where we all began, from cavespeech to mountain/
/to querulous plain./

/Twas for nought if a child in the darkness lays, there's nought in Good/
/if Good this stays, and Good hath nought to teach these Days --/
/If true, and can't we hope for isn't?/
/When was the last the Protector listen'd?/
/Who knows, for the old were then young at that!/
/Mortar, stoneways, parchment, drat!/
#+end_verse

  The whispers kept on going like this, fading in and out of my hearing, each verse getting longer and longer. From time to time they would `return to zero', so to speak, and begin again from the same place, though as you might imagine they would travel in slightly different paths at first, and the paths traversed by those verses as they grew and grew would diverge more and more, until they had wended their way into topics and territories new and strange, completely different from those which had come before.

  Of course, this structure, once heard, can be imagined to be the product, not only of great effort on the part of the VerseMaster, but of the world itself. Note that it begins so simply, with a word. Much like our Universe, some believe. Then there is another word, another single syllable. Then a word of two syllables, followed by three syllables, and so on. This is in fact also tied to a mathematical sequence which has been known in these lands for many years, and which has many interesting properties.

  I did not know all this instantly at the time I heard those rhythmic whispers in that cell long ago, but slowly over a period of hours, as the chanting continued, I was able to gather information, and in fact I was rather in awe of this creature who could compose such a verse, in real time, as it were, and whose command of number and verse together were strange and unknown to me. Of course, there are those who exceed in the narrow and sometimes austere way of Number, and those who travel freely the winding path of Verse, but few there are who tread with one foot upon each. So this was a very strange creature indeed, that I discovered outside my cell on that day.

  And what of that sequence? Well, let me describe it for you: it is in fact simplicity itself, such that even a child can understand its basic operation. Let us begin with 0. Adding 1 to the previous number, we have 1 again. Add 1 and 1 to make 2. Add 2 to the previous value of 1, and you have 3. 3 and 2 are 5.

  Let me draw this out for you over at the table. Yes, do come on over here with me, please. Don't mind that stack of books, but do mind the candle. Yes, here's a nice blank space on the vellum for me to write upon. Yes, where were we? The sequence. And so:

  |   1 |
  |   1 |
  |   2 |
  |   3 |
  |   5 |
  |   8 |
  |  13 |
  |  21 |
  |  34 |
  |  55 |
  |  89 |
  | 144 |
  | ... |

  And on and on and on...

  This sequence has a special name here. As it is quite well-known among the society of Numbermasters in our world, I can only assume that it has been given a name in your world as well. Do you know what it is? No, I suppose not, young thing that you are. Here we call it the ``Biscalar Sequence", which is to say: ``the ladder built of two", though in this case we are concerned with a ladder that scales to the very stars. For this sequence has some quite explosive properties indeed. Perhaps we would be best served by a picture? Yes, let me draw it out here, in the corner. And do fetch another sheet of vellum from that cabinet over there. The mahogany, yes.

  Let's begin with a circle to represent each digit, like so:

  [Figure 13.2: STACKED CIRCLES: FIRST FIVE NUMBERS IN FIBONACCI SEQUENCE]

  As described, each number in the sequence is the sum of the two preceding numbers. Which of course you can see from the list of numbers I wrote above. What are some of the properties of this sequence, however? Now you will catch a glimpse of the Numbermaster's Art, and what goes into it: no less than the constant questioning of all! Especially where number series are concerned, there are several essential properties to be aware of, and for each property there are several questions we must ask (Note that these we discuss here are by no means exhaustive, but are merely an introduction, my dear Avis, and the gentlest at that).

  Often series of numbers are referred to as /sums/, or can be thought of that way. And one of the most important qualities of sums are whether they are /convergent/ or /divergent/, which is to say: as we keep adding/subtracting/doing-Protector-knows-what to the elements of the series, do they shoot off toward ∞, with the sum growing ever larger and larger and larger? (I'll give you a hint, or more precisely, the same hint I already gave you, and tell you again that the ``ladder of two leads to the stars", which is an old bird's silly way of saying that it heads ever upward towards ∞. That is to say, it is a /divergent/ sum. It is also, incidentally, an old peasant saying about the value of marriage, which is rather funny, I think.)

  This is easy to see with our beloved `ladder' (here, I'll write it straight across -- might be a bit clearer this way, in case you hadn't got it before):

  | 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 5 | 8 | 13 | 21 | 34 | 55 | 89 | ... | ∞. |

  Clearly, this is a creature that climbs ever higher and higher, into the very topmost branches of the World Tree! No one can hope to contain such a beast for long. Try to chase it and you will quickly tire. Try to describe the /n/ th item in the sequence (for a large value of /n/), and life quickly becomes difficult (unless you are in possession of a mechanical aid, of course, but that is a discussion for later, my dear Avis. You aren't ready yet!).

  As for /convergent sums/, they tend to hover more and more closely in and around a certain value, which is (again) to say: each term in the series adds less and less to the total, and so it ``converges", or comes to rest, around a particular number, which some unenlightened creatures refer to as the `answer'. But naturally there are no true answers for an inquisitive mind. Only ever and always new questions!

  An example of a convergent sum? Very well, then you shall have it, and in fact, it's right here in front of you. Or perhaps one should say: we're very close to it. As you've just seen, the Biscalar Sequence is an infinite sum (or divergent, if you prefer). Therefore, if we attempt to sum all of the terms in that sequence, we quickly shoot off into the blue, grow spiritually fatigued, question our place in the universe, the meaning thereof, &c.

  However, if we sum the /reciprocals/ of the sequence, we meet with another result entirely.

  You've had reciprocals in your schooling, haven't you, Avis? I'll recap quickly, just in case.

  Given a number /n/, place it in the denominator of a fraction. Let the numerator of that fraction be 1 (which is also known as /unity/, which is quite a beautiful way of describing it, don't you think?). Let me write out a few examples for you, just so:

  |    n | 1/n     |
  |------+---------|
  |    1 | 1/1 = 1 |
  |   13 | 1/13    |
  |   42 | 1/42    |
  | 1257 | 1/1257  |

  Note that the reciprocal of unity (1) is itself unity (1).

  As I was saying: if we sum the reciprocals of the Biscalar, we go from the Biscalar itself

  | 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 5 | 8 | 13 | 21 | 34 | 55 | 89 | ... | ∞ |

  to the sum which is known as the Reciprocal Biscalar Constant.

  | 1/1 | 1/1 | 1/2 | 1/3 | 1/5 | 1/8 | 1/13 | 1/21 | 1/34 | 1/55 | 1/89 | ... | 3.3598... |

  This is just a rather scary-sounding way of saying ``a single number which is created by summing the reciprocals of the Biscalar Sequence".

  Written together, the picture becomes a bit clearer, and of course one should pay special attention to the rightmost values (that is, the sums).

  |   1 |   1 |   2 |   3 |   5 |   8 |   13 |   21 |   34 |   55 |   89 | ... |         ∞ |
  | 1/1 | 1/1 | 1/2 | 1/3 | 1/5 | 1/8 | 1/13 | 1/21 | 1/34 | 1/55 | 1/89 | ... | 3.3598... | 

  I hope I haven't bored you with this rambling on of mine, Avis. We haven't known each other for very long, after all, and I do tend to go on so. Oh, no I haven't? Well, I don't believe you, for after all you are a very nice young girl and of course I would expect that you're just far too polite to admit that you're stuck in this room with a strange old creature like me, listening to me ramble on about mathematics and other foolishness! Perhaps it's time I got back to my story?

As I was saying, this sequence we've just been discussing corresponds precisely to the syllabic structure of the verse spells that Meldrake was chanting outside my cell when he arrived, thereby informing me that the creature with whom I would soon be dealing was in fact a reasonably powerful VerseMaster and no mere flatterer or pretender to same, and it explains to you, I hope, the combination of elation and trepidation which flooded over me at that time.

I had been sitting and listening to the chanting of this creature for some time, and had completely lost my focus on anything other than the rhythmic chanting of his voice. After some time it had become rather hypnotic, you see. Presently it stopped, and I heard the owner of that same voice step towards my door, and then he spoke: ``Stand in front of the door."

I was very near the door, but was seated, as I've said. I stood and positioned myself directly in front of the door as this stranger had asked. Were it some mere brawler or swordfighter who'd given me that order, I might have balked, supposing that such a one would soon come crashing through that door and onto me. However, I had by now seen (or is it heard?) enough evidence that this fellow was trained in the subtler Arts that I deduced that he must know enough about trees and creatures and the connections 'tween that this would not happen.

As for what happened next, it's difficult to explain, or even to describe. Have you ever noticed a sound hovering just at the edge of your hearing? It's so faint that you have a hard time distinguishing it from silence, and you only realize a bit later that what you were hearing was your own blood as it rushed through the veins in your ear. Well, as I stood there behind that door, waiting for what I hoped was my rescue, I began to notice something like that. It began as a low hum coming from the other side of the door, but before many seconds had passed I perceived that this sound had grown somehow, and was now in the room with me as well.

In fact, before many seconds had passed, I knew that the sound was coming from inside me, and from my diaphragm in particular. I was humming the sound myself! And this was no `strolling through the woods on a clear day' sort of humming, either. More like: an elemental vibrational force that was emerging from my body, and the frequency I was emitting matched that which came from the other side of the door and joined with it, filling first my belly and chest and then the room around me!

After this synchronization had been reached, my partner beyond the door and I continued our monotonous duet for two or three minutes' time, during which I felt that we were communicating via these sound waves in some way that I don't really understand. Gradually the sound from behind the door grew less and less, and I was obliged to match it. Within another minute or so, we had finished, and I stood there trying to understand a strange feeling which was now filling my body.

And what's more, I found myself standing in the hallway outside my cell door.

* LITTLE SISTERS AND THEIR GAMES

Marla McGinty awoke in the middle of the night to the sound of her mother's voice downstairs. Despite the late hour, Mrs. McGinty was speaking rather loudly to someone on the telephone. Marla knew that Glynis still hadn't come home when it was time for her to go to bed, but that had been the plan, hadn't it? Marla's usual bedtime of 8:30 had come and gone, and the plan had been for Glynis and John to be picked up at the hotel by Mrs. Sharp, John's mother.

Apparently that hadn't happened, and now it was late in the evening (or early in the morning? Marla couldn't tell), and Mrs. McGinty was clearly upset.

What Marla didn't know was that Mrs. Sharp had been at the Hotel Skidmore at the appointed time to pick up Glynis and John, and Brian Smalls, the front desk clerk, had had to admit that it had been some time since he'd seen the pair. Mr. Stephens, the front desk clerk, hadn't any idea where they were either. Naturally, Brian took his flashlight and went into the hotel basement to retrieve them, and found it empty. Of course, he had to blunder around among the rows of dusty armoires, chests of drawers, and the like for some time before he could confirm that the children were not, in fact, in the basement. At that point he spoke to Mr. Stephens, who was the hotel manager after all, and informed him that they should have the hotel searched. Mr. Stephens gathered all of the evening shift employees together, and they began searching the hotel.

All of this as a horrified Mrs. Sharp looked on. Her first move was to call her friend Jane McGinty who lived down the road, and who was also, as it happened, Marla's mother. Jane was understandably upset. After all, Marla and John were only 12 years old, and it was only because the children had asked to work together on this project in the hotel in the first place that they'd been allowed to be out like this in the evening, and unsupervised at that. Since Jane had Marla at home, they agreed that Mrs. Sharp would stay at the hotel and coordinate with the manager and perhaps the police while Mrs. McGinty stayed with Marla. Mrs. McGinty was quite upset, and thought about waking Marla in order to go and join the search for Glynis and John. On the helpful advice of her good and sensible friend Mrs. Sharp, she decided to avoid scaring poor little Marla by waking her in the middle of the night. She then hung up the phone and decided to do just that. After all, how could she sit at home when Glynis was out there somewhere by herself? Who knew where she was? Having lived in Lake William for almost her entire life, save some travelling about here and there, Mrs. McGinty didn't think they'd been kidnapped. No, rather than something so sinister, she supposed that they had gotten themselves hidden away in some long-closed part of the giant old hotel, a part that hadn't been maintained for many years, and that one of them had gotten hurt, or they had gotten lost or become trapped somehow. Which was an upsetting thing for a mother to think, naturally, but there was little sinister about it, really.

She went upstairs to find that Marla was already awake, having been awakened by her rather loud phone conversation with Mrs. Sharp.

Unfortunately, Mr. Stephens and his staff had not had any luck finding the children, and so they decided to contact the county sherriff. You see, Lake William was too small to have its own police force, and so they depended on the county sherriff to protect them from all of those things that terrorize small towns in the mountains: loud teenagers, occasional shoplifters, and of course, tourists from the cities. Taken in sum, the threat was small, if not nonexistent, even combining the three groups. Therefore there was no need to finance a small town police force, what with the expensive proposition of a dedicated building, support staff, vehicles, etc. And of course, the pay, insurance, and pensions for the officers themselves.

So it was that only five or ten minutes were allowed to pass between Mr. Stephens' call to the Sherriff's Office and the arrival of a police cruiser. Naturally, the sherriff knew the hotel, and like everyone else in Lake William knew its enormous size, and supposed, like Mrs. McGinty, that such a large old place, with so many dark and dusty corners, provided lots of nooks and crannies in which a pair of children could get lost. And hopefully that was all there was to it.

But we know that was not all there was to it. For Glynis and John were not in the hotel, having passed through the door with the stained glass window some hours earlier, at around sunset, which of course meant that they arrived in the White Bear's Realm at around sunrise. After all, what sort of magical realm would it be if the hours of their day matched ours exactly? Why, not a very magical sort of place at all, I dare say. And so this was the situation at hand, what with John's abduction and subsequent travelling about the countryside, and Glynis and Meldrake's having escaped to the Ravenslair for some magical inquiry and discussion that, they hoped, would begin to prepare them for their journey south, to the land where their adversary held sway, and where they erroneously believed that John had been taken.

But their families back in Lake William had no way of knowing this, of course. And so the search continued apace.

Meanwhile, Mrs. McGinty had gone to Marla's room to wake her, only to find the already wakeful girl there.

"Marla. Marla."

"Mom, I'm awake," replied Marla.

"Sweetie, I hate to have to tell you this, but your sister and John are late. They were supposed to be picked up by Mrs. Sharp a couple of hours ago, and now no one can find them," said Mrs. McGinty.

"Why not? Where did they go?" asked Marla, who wasn't sure yet whether to be worried or not.

"Well, we don't know. It's most likely that they're just lost somewhere inside that big old hotel," replied Mrs. McGinty.

"Are they OK?" Now Marla was sure it was time to worry, at least a little. For inasmuch as she enjoyed pestering her older sister at every opportunity, she also looked up to her and loved her.

"We don't know for sure, but I think so. I think they're lost, and they need us to go and help find them. Will you come with me, sweet, and help find them?" asked Mrs. McGinty.

"Of course!" said Marla, and she bounded out of bed. She had only to throw on pants, shirt, and a light jacket, and she was ready to go in no time flat. Marla and her mother were in the Jeep and heading over the mountain road at speed in what seemed no time at all. Before she knew it, Marla was hanging on for dear life as her mother, ever prone to driving a bit too quickly, had gone beyond the mere need for speed, and had now entered ``frightened mother trying to get to her child" territory. And how the Jeep flew over the mountain roads that night! Poor Marla had to shut her eyes more than once as Mrs. McGinty flung the Jeep into a twisty turn at speed.

Finally, the pair arrived at the Hotel Skidmore, and Mrs. McGinty pulled into an empty parking space. Marla jumped out of the car practically before it had stopped.

"Marla! Wait for me!" called Mrs. McGinty.

Marla barely heard her mother. Between being awakened in the middle of the night, and being driven over the mountain by a madwoman, she was wide awake and ready for action. On this night, nothing was going to stop her from finding her big sister. She ran to the front doors of the hotel, and met a police officer there.

"Hello, miss. Can I help you?" asked the officer.

"Yes, I'm here to find my sister, she's lost!" replied Marla as she ran past the officer.

Mrs. McGinty was not far behind, however, and managed to grab her daughter by the arm. "Oh no, you don't," she said. "I'm not losing two daughters at once."

Mrs. McGinty turned to the officer standing there.  "Officer, is there any news about my daughter? I'm Glynis' mother, Jane McGinty." She held out her hand.

The officer shook Mrs. McGinty's hand. "I'm Officer Simpson. I'm afraid I don't have any updates. There are six officers searching the building from top to bottom right now, along with the hotel manager and staff."

"How can I help?" asked Mrs. McGinty.

"You'll want to coordinate with Chief Stone. He's in the dining room, you can't miss him," replied the officer.

"I'll do that." Mrs. McGinty took Marla by the hand and walked into the old hotel. The dining room was not far ahead, just past the lobby. It was a grand old room, with high ceilings and carved wooden beams. The West wall was all windows, and looked out over the lake, the better to provide a relaxing view for diners to enjoy. There was nothing to see now but the blackness of night, however, and anyway Mrs. McGinty was in no mood for relaxing. She spied the hotel manager Mr. Stephens and the police chief standing near one of the tables on the far side of the room. They were talking.

Mrs. McGinty walked over briskly, Marla in tow, and injected herself into their conversation. "Chief Stone, I presume? Mr. Stephens." There was cordiality but no patience whatsoever in her voice, and she addressed them as if expecting a status report.

As they all lived in the same small town, and knew who she was upon sight, they obliged her. The police chief began. "Mrs. McGinty, we have six officers searching this hotel in a grid, top to bottom. We've begun with the roof and the top floors and we're working our way down."

Mrs. McGinty was not pleased. "My daughter and her friend were working in the basement. Why aren't you looking there?" she said sharply.

"We need to search the entire hotel, top to bottom. Besides, the children haven't been seen for several hours. They could have taken a break and wandered anywhere. They weren't seen leaving, however, so we've no reason to believe they aren't somewhere in the building," he added, in an attempt to reassure her.

"And you'll get to the basement soon." Mrs. McGinty made it a statement rather than a question.

"Yes," replied Chief Stone.

"Jane! Marla!" It was Mrs. Sharp, calling to them as she came into the dining room. "Oh my goodness Jane, I'm so glad you're here. I'm just about worried sick. I guess you decided to bring her after all," she added, with a glance at Marla. "Very well then. What do you say we go and look for them together?"

"Yes, let's." Mrs. McGinty nodded briefly at Chief Stone and Mr. Stephens and made a beeline for Mrs. Sharp, who had already turned and begun to lead the way to where she hoped Glynis and John could be found. Naturally, Marla was towed along in her wake, having been unable to get out of her mother's tight grip since they'd arrived.

"Bethany, do you know how to get to the basement?" asked Mrs. McGinty. Marla was sure she'd never heard Mrs. Sharp's first name before.

"Yes, that's where we're headed. Brian Smalls, the front desk clerk, is there now, and he showed me how to get down there," replied Mrs. Sharp. "Be prepared, it's a bit of a conflagration to get there."

"It's already a conflagration," Mrs. McGinty said (somewhat grimly, Marla thought), and Mrs. Sharp nodded her assent.

Like Glynis had before her, Marla followed her mother and Mrs. Sharp out of the dining room and into the lobby, and from there they followed the hall to the North Wing of the hotel. They followed the hall all the way to the end of the building, and found themselves at a narrow wooden door. It was slightly ajar, and opened onto a dark, narrow stairwell.

"Here are the stairs," said Mrs. Sharp. "Be careful, the stairwell is very narrow, and the steps are high," added Mrs. Sharp as she began the descent in front. From her coat pocket she produced a flashlight to light their way.

Marla was second to go, between Mrs. Sharp and her mother. The light from Mrs. Sharp's flashlight was throwing strange, jumping shadows up along the walls of the narrow stair. Marla could see a strange pattern covering the walls, and it seemed to move as she moved, swaying, ocean-like, to the rhythm of Mrs. Sharp's footfalls. In truth, they were down the stairs and it was all over in a matter of seconds, but Marla still thought it strange. Once inside the door to the stairwell, the hotel had become very different, you see. Its old bones were exposed, the wallpaper and ceilings and carpets and floors just as they had been long ago, when the hotel had been built. Or at least so Marla thought, though it was hard for her to imagine old things, since she was only ten years old. Everything older than ten seemed quite ancient, and even her sister Glynis, at twelve, was practically unbearably old and dour and uptight in Marla's eyes.

"Stay close behind me now. We're coming to an opening in the floor," Mrs. Sharp warned. Marla and Mrs. McGinty followed close behind. It was the middle of the night, and full dark now. And inside the bowels of the hotel, where light never came, it probably didn't matter, but Marla sensed that the dark here was darker somehow than it would have been had they come down during the day.

"Here it is," said Mrs. Sharp. They were creeping along slowly now, and Marla could see the opening in the floor where the trapdoors swung wide. The top of a ladder was poking up through the opening. "We're going down that?" Marla had to ask. It looked like both a bad idea (if one doesn't want to break one's neck) and a good idea (if one feels like exploring and possibly having an adventure) at the same time.

"I'll go first." Marla stepped toward the opening, only to feel her mother grab her arm from behind. "No, I will," said Mrs. McGinty, "and that's that." Marla knew better than to argue with her mother, and said nothing. /I guess I should be glad she let me come at all/, she thought to herself. And then: /I wonder if Glynis is down that ladder somewhere. But if she is, how come no one's found her?/

"Brian! It's me, Bethany! I've brought Jane McGinty, Glynis' mother, and her sister Marla." Mrs. Sharp was yelling into the trapdoor opening. This interrupted Marla's questions and brought her back to the very real, and very dark, room in which they stood.

From far inside the room (cavern?) beneath came a distant "Hello..." that Marla assumed must be this Brian person. Glynis had mentioned him once or twice, but all Marla knew about him was that he worked the front desk at the hotel, and Glynis had said he was friendly. Beyond that, Marla knew nothing. It /was/ nice of him to help out with trying to find Glynis, though. Or so thought Marla.

Another "Hello.." sounded, this one closer than the last. And again: "Hello!" Ten seconds later Marla and the two women heard footfalls on the floor beneath them, and finally Brian called up to them, this time close enough to hear. "Hello! Bethany? Is that you? I'm coming up," he added, and they finally saw a brown-haired head poke up through the trap door, followed by a man dressed in what appeared to be a formerly white dress shirt and loosened tie. His face was streaked with dirt, and he looked rather tired, Marla thought, but he smiled a small smile when he saw Mrs. Sharp, and then Marla and Mrs. McGinty.

"Hello Brian. Have you had any luck?" This time it was Mrs. McGinty's turn to speak.

"No, I'm afraid not, Mrs. McGinty. I've been over and under and around almost everything down there. At least everything I know about," he added.

"That's why we're here," replied Marla's mother. "I can only imagine they're lost somewhere in some strange corner of this place, and we're going to find it."

"Follow me, then." Brian could tell that Mrs. McGinty was determined, and he didn't waste time with more talk. Instead he led them back to the trapdoor. "I'll go down first and hold the ladder for the rest of you. I trust you've got flashlights?" Mrs. McGinty nodded that they did. "Ok. The basement storage is basically stuffed top to bottom with furniture, but there are rows for walking. My only guess is that they discovered a secret room or a hole in the wall and decided to go exploring. So I guess we should keep our eyes open for any little doors or passageways around the outer walls, or for that matter in the floor. Though I think we are in the true basement now; I can't imagine that there's very far to go from here, but then again I haven't found them have I?" This last he said with a sort of grimace of pain, and without further comment he stepped down onto the ladder into the gloom of the room below.

	*		*		*

Marla's eyes were closed, but she could tell that it was bright
outside. The brightness of whatever lay behind her eyelids was
difficult to ignore. But she tried. She felt so tired, what with her
mother having awakened her in the middle of the night and all, that
she would have much preferred to keep them closed. But why was it so
bright out?

In fact, why were her eyes closed at all? Just minutes ago she had
been in the basement of the Hotel Skidmore with her mother, Mrs.
Sharp, and Brian the front desk clerk. What had she been doing before
the world went dark? She remembered a dark room with lots of
furniture, and then nothing.

She opened her eyes just a bit. They focused on blades of grass, and
she could feel grass against her face. She looked up towards the sky
and saw that she was beneath a large tree.

Water dripped down from the tree branches onto her face. She noticed
for the first time that her hair and clothes were wet. The brightness
wasn't so bright after all, as it turned out. Although compared to the
hotel basement where she'd been just moments before, almost
anything was bright.

``Hello? Is anyone there?'' Now that Marla was looking around her a
bit, she began to feel confused. She was laying beneath a pine tree,
or some other evergreen, in a bed of red needles. She was wet, though
not as wet as she could be, given that it was pouring down rain out
there, beyond the shelter of the tree branches.

``Hello?'' She tried again. She began to look around more closely, to
see if this was some place in the woods that she knew. Although Glynis
was more likely to spend time in the woods, Marla had accompanied her
now and then, and had at least a passing familiarity with the woods in
and around Lake William.

``Fine! I'll find my own way out,'' she said to no one in particular.
The tree she lay beneath was surrounded by others like it, mostly
large evergreens. Some yards away she could see an opening. Beyond
that, it was hard to tell where she was. She turned over onto her
stomach and began to crawl out from under the big pine. The further
she got from the center of the tree, the wetter she became. /Where is
everyone? Why am I here by myself?/ she wondered to herself.

/<You are not alone, child.>/

Marla froze. After the first minute or so, she hadn't actually
expected anyone to be there to answer her, here in the middle of the
forest. Besides, the voice did not have a pleasant sound.

/<Wouldn't you rather be warm and dry? Come to the clearing.>/

She definitely didn't like the sound of that voice. Also, her mother
had taught her never to speak to strangers, and this was without any
doubt the voice of a stranger.

Marla responded to the voice by crawling out from under the edge of
the tree and walking in the opposite direction, away from the
clearing.

Of course, this only took her further into the dark forest.

<Wait! That way lies danger, and foes, and almost-certain doom.>

Marla was done with fear and, now soaking wet and cold, had moved
directly on to annoyance: ``Why should I listen to you? What kind of
person tries to lure someone into a clearing in the middle of the
woods? My mother warned me about people like you!'' This last was
nearly a shout, for Marla was on her way past annoyance to becoming
very cross indeed.

%Indeed. You are right to suspect a stranger in the cold rain. But the
way you travel leads nowhere, or at least, deeper into the forest, and
deeper into wet and cold. You'll find no respite there, and I am
merely trying to warn and help you.%

Throughout all this, Marla hadn't ceased her brisk walk away from the
clearing, and she realized that the volume of the stranger's voice
hadn't changed, even though she was drawing further and further away.
She decided to try a test. She would only whisper or speak at a low
volume.  Surely this person in the clearing wouldn't be able to hear
her then?

``I might be able to go with you, if only I knew you could be
trusted.'' Marla said this last so quietly she could barely hear
herself. It must have been very cold and wet indeed, for Marla to be
able to say that!  And against her mother's prohibition on talking to
strangers, even. But cold rain has a power over a person, especially
having got into your hair and all of your clothes.

To her surprise, the voice responded.

* THE SMALLWOOD

``Welcome, friends." The voice that emerged from behind the gate was deep as a mountain. Though its words were friendly words, that voice had a language all its own that spoke of deep forests and things not to be trespassed against. The door was now fully open, and John could see the brown hulk that had stood behind it. He craned his neck to see the broad face and murderous snout, from which those friendly words had emerged, and realized the reason for the height of the arch. The bear stood on its hind legs and surveyed them calmly; John wished like anything that he could read the facial expressions of bears, but he supposed that the lack of bared fangs reassured him somewhat. 

``I see you've brought a new friend", said the brown bear.

``Indeed we have. And how does this day find you, old friend?", asked Vellus, the Verse Badger.

``Bright sun outside. Cool, dark forest inside. The Long River beside me, teeming with fish. What more should a bear want from the world?" It seemed obvious, to hear him say it.

``A fair point. Would that we were all so grateful for a day in the Realm. I'm sure you remember my brother, who is called `Second' by some, though he was the first in our litter. As for my new friend, I'm sure the two of you will get on famously; he is called `Ursus', and comes from a strange place very much like and unlike our own. This you can guess, I think". With that he pointed at John, who gave the bear a nod. This was a silent gesture that he had learned from watching his father's dealings with other men, and it seemed appropriate here.

``Ursus." The bear paused. `` I have seen his like before, travelling with the grey wretch. Small things, though I admit that they know some magics."

``I'm sure you're right, though this fellow is newly arrived here, and rather a different creature altogether from that lot, I dare say."

``One hopes."

John Sharp was not entirely sure who or what they were talking about (e.g., Who was the ``grey wretch"?), but he had learned, again from his father, that often it was best not to ask questions and make oneself a nuisance generally; rather, the best course of action was usually to listen, learn by seeing, and to see only what was there, and not what you wanted to see. This method was generally more trustworthy, even in John's limited experience, than listening to voices coming out of mouths (a phenomenon otherwise known to John's father as ``hot air"). Talk fell under the same category as all of those other things that John's father mistrusted, along with feelings, emotions, desires, and so on, up to and including people who didn't keep their pocketknives clean and sharp. Even more untrustworthy were those who didn't carry pocketknives at all.

John supposed that the bear to whom they were speaking did not carry a pocketknife, unless of course one counted the dozens of sharp teeth and claws at his disposal. He was pretty sure that his father would allow for such an exception, were he present.

Meanwhile, pleasantries dispensed with, the bear turned and dropped to all fours, moving aside that they three might pass. Once they had stepped inside the gate proper, the creature rose again and closed the heavy doors, chaining them once more against the town.

John stood and looked up at the pines. This was an evergreen forest, a good /northern/ forest, there could be no doubt about it. Even more so than the country he'd traveled through with Glynis and Meldrake, this place reminded him of the forests surrounding his home back in Lake William. The sunlight glinted through openings in the canopy of pine and spruce branches, and the ground was covered in red needles. Ferns grew everywhere between the trunks of the taller trees, and the smell of pine, pitch and needle, hung in the cool air.

It was, John decided, a place of great peace. He instantly began to relax. Even so, his thoughts turned to Glynis. ``Will she and Meldrake ever be able to find me, here on the forest floor? How could they see me?" He wasn't especially worried about his safety --after all, Glynis was in more danger than he-- so much as about losing track of his friend in this strange, great wide world.

``Well, we've quite a trip ahead!" All thoughts of reflection were dismissed immediately upon any occasion when Vellus opened his mouth. ``I do so enjoy a nice trip abroad!"

``How long do you think it will take?" asked John. He wanted to see how Vellus would answer the question.

``Hopefully, not long at all", was the badger's reply. ``Via the smallwood, what once took weeks can be travelled in days. Once arduous journeys are accomplished with relative ease. Naturally, that ease is purchased by our friendship with the bears, which is a precious thing which few have earned. Note, young sir", he said, turning to look at John, ``that I said /earned/, not /purchased/. There is no gold or silver in this world that will sway a bear. It isn't that they're incorruptible, it's just that money is about as useful to them as a pinecone to you or I, which is to say: it's a cute little thing that I might find along the forest path, but it serves me not in any real way, and thus has no real value."

``Gold and silver are of no importance." The brown mountain could speak as well as amble along the path.

``You'll do well to remember that," Vellus reminded John with a whisper.

``Only life is important," added the bear, whose name John still had not heard yet.

John decided to be bold and to ask: ``What is a name I can know you by, Sir Bear?"

``It may be that you never truly know me," came the reply. ``But if you would do so, you can begin by calling me ARCTORYX. I have lived in the north as a youth, and of late I have toured far afield in the smallwoods. I have achieved the rank of CHARTOPHYLAX, which means that I am a keeper of scrolls."

After that, the bear said no more, which came as no surprise. ``I suppose I can ask my questions later", John thought to himself. ``Or maybe my eyes will get the answers before my mouth", he thought. ``Either way, I've got to get myself oriented, and get a handle on where I am and how to go about finding Glynis." He decided the place to start was to begin tracking the movements of the sun, its rising and setting, as well as the directions in which it did so. ``After all, I don't have any reason to believe that there is an `East' or`West' here, but I guess I'll use those words anyway. If I can figure out where I am and where I've been, I may be able to map out just where I'm going."

So it was that John settled on the idea of becoming an amateur heliographer and cartographer, though he might not have thought of himself that way. He had a little notebook in his front pocket, and a pencil that he could sharpen with his pocketknife, and so counted himself lucky. Here were his first scientific instruments (those, and his mind). Now he needed a way of determining direction.

By now it was approaching late afternoon. John's best guess, based on the shadows in the forest, and the spare light coming down, put the time at around five. So far the length of the days seemed to be about what he was used to at home, which gave him some hope that the sun's movements would prove to be, well, similarly similar. Indeed, as the small troupe continued through the evergreen forest, the sun's rays entered at an increasingly steep angle, until they appeared to be entering from the side, and from time to time would even shine into one's eyes.

Contrasted with this sudden brightness, the rest of the forest grew ever darker. There were of course pine trees all around, many growing to heights of what John guessed was about 60 to 70 feet. They provided a canopy of sorts, under which John could see stands of spruce, wet areas dominated by red or ``swamp" cedar growth, and of course the indomitable birches which lined the small open meadows and other open areas, such as those along several streams they passed. Or was it the same long stream? John decided that this was most likely, or rather that it was unlikely that there would be several streams in an area with almost exactly the same characteristic width and rate of flow. Yes, the birches. They were always the first trees to recolonize an area that had been lost to the forest. Those which grew here were whiter than any John had ever seen, much more so than those he knew from his home. Gone were the patches of grey and black bands which lined the trunks of many of the trees he had known. These were unblemished and stunning.

Beneath all this, there was the ubiquitous carpet of red needles and various small flora of the forest floor. Most important of all these were the humble ferns which throve amid their complementary blankets of moss. Thus was the forest floor divided among a few states, each equally beautiful: covered in a blanket of red pine and other needles (this described the path upon which our little group travelled); almost invisible under a symphony of bright green ferns, gentle harpsichords strewn about the forest floor wherever there was soil enough to meet their humble needs; and wherever needle and fern failed, such as upon the large rock outcroppings which were everywhere inside the smallwood, there grew the tenacious yet fragile green moss that John loved, that said to him: ``You are in a real forest now; be at peace."

As the four creatures wended their way through the tall pines, the day wore on. The shadows, already long, grew longer still. Bright shafts pierced the dark stillness and came to rest against tree trunks, and were beautiful to look upon. Were one to raise his eyes and look towards the setting sun at the wrong moment, though, he might take one of those bright arrows of light directly in the eye, and at that time of day, they are blinding. Therefore John was content to look around him in wonder, and not speak.

The bear led the new-formed troupe, followed by Vellus, John, and finally Second. As the rearguard, John supposed that Second was nominally charged with ensuring that the badgers' prisoner didn't escape. Of course, in that forest, surrounded by those creatures, the idea of escape was folly itself. No human living can outrun a bear. And even if Arctoryx weren't interested in chasing humans (and we can be reasonably certain that he wouldn't be, without a very good reason indeed), one imagines that badgers such as these, of such size and ferocity, would prove difficult adversaries and pursuers indeed.

For all that, John didn't feel at all threatened. Though clearly these were creatures who could be ferocious at need, they did not seem to revel in it, at least by John Sharpe's reckoning. And despite his young age, John's reckoning of the situation was a rather good one, I should think.

Finally the arrows of light fell short of their marks, for the sun was very nearly set, and the forest was fast approaching darkness. John was having some difficulty seeing, but luckily he had badgers ahead and behind. And so they walked along in darkness for some time. John was sure that the smallwood, or at least that part of it which they had perceived from the street in Halfmoon, was much smaller indeed than the place through which they were now travelling. And of course he was right. Since the smallwoods are, by definition, rather magical (what with their various properties, both supernatural and not, which we've discussed thus far), their passage through the oaken gates had indeed marked a passage of an altogether different kind.

John both knew this and didn't, if one can be in such a state. ``Of course this place isn't really in the middle of a park in Halfmoon, `` he thought to himself. ``The light was coming in almost completely from the side at sunset. The buildings on the street would've blocked that light, if we'd been in town. Therefore, we are no longer in a small park in the middle of town, but someplace else." John also suspected that any readings he might gather from observing the stars in this place would have a usefulness which was also confined to this place. Despite that technicality, he resolved to begin charting his observations of the night sky at the earliest convenience.

``Yes," he thought. ``I can begin noting the locations of certain constellations tonight, whenever we get where we're going. Then I can compare their locations to whatever direction the sun comes up from tomorrow. That should give me some notion of the East and West of this place, and it will allow me to start navigating by the stars. At least it's more than I know how to do right now, and every bit will help if I'm going to be able to travel on my own."

More trudging ensued. Thankfully, the bear was both capable of great speed and indolent in general, an unusual combination. No doubt if John had been travelling with the badgers alone he would've needed carrying again, and he was tired of feeling like someone else's cargo. ``When can I get my own powers?" he wondered. ``I'd like to be able to do some neat things, too. Like change into a bear, or a wolf, or an eagle. But especially a bear. Then maybe I could find my way around this place more easily, and most of all find Glynis, and help her." Unfortunately, hoping for a single great power you don't have while ignoring the many important, if humbler, powers that you do is a fairly common human trait. And John was not immune to such folly, human boy that he was. And little did he know that he had a diamond in his pocket! But that is a story which we'll hear soon enough, Gentle Reader...

Some little time later they began to see a tiny red glowing point far ahead through the trees. Arctoryx stopped abruptly and turned, presumably to address the group. They'd now been walking for several hours. Vellus, who'd been following him closely -- and perhaps a bit impatiently -- helpfully bumped right into him and then fell down.

John had to laugh. Then Second started in, and Vellus, after recovering from the initial shock of it, started laughing too. Arctoryx seemed unable to laugh, or perhaps just unwilling in this company. Instead, he simply spoke. ``In a few moments, we'll be approaching the Great Camp which is called O-Kwa-Ri-Ga. When we arrive, I'll be the first to speak. The rule for guests in the Smallwood is simple: never speak unless spoken to. Vellus, you and Second know my meaning." He gave John what John imagined was a meaningful look. ``As for you, Ursus, that warning is doubled. I have not followed that rule to the letter with you thus far, but you'd do well to understand that all bears are not the same as me, and mind your tongue. There are some who would rather not see the Creatures of Speech in our woods, for they are considered dangerous by many."

John remembered at that moment some of the things Meldrake had said about the power of language and speech, both those which he had heard directly and those which Glynis had told him about. Arctoryx apparently believed similar things, and John had to admit that he was beginning to wonder if there wasn't some truth to those beliefs. Of course, if witnessing your friend's transformation into a flying creature doesn't convince you of the power of a place's magic...

``Wait," thought John. ``What does he mean, Creatures of Speech? Are there some here that don't talk?" Based upon his experiences thus far, it would have been reasonable for John to assume that all of the animals in the Realm of the White Bear spoke. ``On second thought, there are so many animals everywhere, it would be strange if they all did. And I've only met a few of the total number here, after all. It makes sense that there would be a mixture of the two, I guess. But how did that come about -- why some, and not others?"

John thought briefly of asking Arctoryx about this and other things that had occurred to him. Then he thought better of it.

Arctoryx went on. ``Ursus, you are also in peril for different reasons. I do not know you, and cannot vouch for you, but as Vellus and Second are trusted, you are trusted. Do not abuse that privilege which they have extended to you."

``Wait. How can I think of this as a privilege? Aren't I a prisoner?" asked John.

Arctoryx shrugged, and Vellus replied. ``We are on a journey together, young Ursus, and it is one as much of curiosity as of duty. My brother and I have been ordered to deliver you to the headquarters of the so-called 'HOLCREDT CONSORTIUM,' and we may in fact do just that, if it pleases us. Or mayhaps it won't after all -- we may go there for a visit on a lark, decide we don't like the looks of the place, and then turn and leave, and help you go and find your friends. We are not beholden to some distant and abstract power, even if it may appear so. Just remember that the crazed leader of our little band is my mother's brother. That's why we humor him, and do little things for him here and there, but we don't truly serve him or his so-called masters. Badgers are not bears or ravens, but in one thing we're all the same: we do not like to be ruled over by anyone," added Vellus the Verse Badger.

And so the unlikely troupe traveled along the winding path. They had already come so far as to exhaust poor John's human legs, but not his human will. Thus was his body delivered, along with the rest of him, heart and soul, to their destination for the evening. As they followed the path to O-Kwa-Ri-Ga, it wound this way and that through the forest, a deliberately oblique route if ever there was one. Yet it seemed clear from Arctoryx's little speech that this was indeed a ``Great Camp," and a place of importance. For all John knew it was a place of some as-yet-undiscovered magic as well. Whether that power would belong to the bears, the forest, the odd pair of badgers, John himself -- in the form of Ursus, perhaps? -- or more likely, the earth and trees and wind themselves, would be revealed. ``Or nothing will happen at all," thought John. ``It could just be a camp in the forest, like people have back home." These were his words, but his secret hope was that his words were false, and that his dreams might be true.

Whatever the truth of the place was, it included this -- and this is what John and his captor-companions saw as they emerged from the trees: Arctoryx was true, and O-Kwa-Ri-Ga was a ``Great Camp" indeed! Four stories' worth of peeled timbers rose above them like the bones of a behemoth in the moonlight. Fires were lit throughout the upper and lower halls, and a red glow emerged from the place that lit the clearing upon which it stood as if by a sunrise. As they crossed the grass of the meadow, John could see yet more carvings worked upon it, very much like those which he'd seen at the oaken gates to the Smallwood itself, hours and miles ago. Runes were incised into each of the great timbers which made the bones of the structure, and wherever there was a flat surface, there was a scene carved in relief, many of bears, and some of other creatures. John thought he could see a few birds of the air as well, and a wolf over there. And here, among the birds, was that a raven? It could be Meldrake's twin, down to that floppy hat he wore! And who or what was it that he flew with, in the painting? It seemed to be a giant eagle of some kind -- it was twice the raven's size at least!

That scene was only one of those which covered the hall from one end to the other, high and low. It was well that John had been reminded to be silent in this place, for it saved him from having to speak now, when all he wanted to do was to admire the work before him. Arctoryx led the little group up to the front door, which was itself carved with many wondrous scenes, as you might imagine, and John admired them, too. For several minutes he was occupied with nothing else, his eyes following the carved panels up and down, and what sights they saw there!

The great doors of O-Kwa-Ri-Ga were split into three panels, just as the Smallwood gate had been, and in fact the images carved there were the same as those John had seen at that other gate, and they were these: Cubs in a Pile as Mother Looks On, Bear in a Treetop, and The Contest Beneath the World Tree. Or at least, these were the names which he came up with for each scene, the set of which he had seen twice now in several hours.

In fact, he was so caught up in wonder at the strangeness and beauty of the place that he had failed to notice his companions at all for some few moments now. He realized with a start that he was standing at those massive gates alone. He spun about, looking for the bear and the pair of badgers, and found nothing there but the red glow of the fires lighting the grass, and beyond that the black forest. The moon shone down from on high, and all was quiet.

* AN ABERRATION IN WOOD AND STEEL

``Where was I, dear child? Oh yes, I was telling you all about my escape from the Adversary's tower."

``Yes, Meldrake, you were, but I'm confused. How could you be rescued by Meldrake, since you are yourself Meldrake? I don't understand," said Glynis.

``Do you think there's only one Meldrake? Is there only one Avis?" asked the raven.

``Why yes, I think there is only one of me," replied Glynis.

``Well, that may be, and yet it may not," said Meldrake. ``Perhaps it is best if you understand that my name, as far as you are concerned, is Meldrake, and always has been. It is also something of a title, in the sense that one can be Meldrake and also be /a/ Meldrake. Or more precisely, I am the /latest/ Meldrake. There will be another Meldrake one day, just as there was a Meldrake who walked these woods and flew these skies many thousands of years ago. It may be that there was an Avis who flew these same skies lo those many years ago, and that there will be /another/ Avis after your time here is over," added the raven.

``I don't understand," was all Glynis could say.

``That's quite all right," said Meldrake. ``Avis, some things just are. I can no more explain such things than I can the sky through which we've just flown, or the trees and hills we flew over. This other Meldrake who appeared to me those years ago (or /ur-Meldrake/ if you prefer) saved my mind, and my life. A better explanation I cannot give, and yet here I am, and /my presence is all the explanation I need/. Perhaps one day you and I will know such things as the Maker has seen fit to keep from us in this life. Until then, we can only embrace the mysteries and do what we can to live with honor." The raven said all this in a kindly way, and in fact Glynis was surprised to detect a note of tenderness and even wonder in his voice.

``You've never mentioned a Maker before," replied Glynis. ``Can you tell me more about this? Is this the Creator of your Universe? Of ours?" Glynis was curious to hear about the religious beliefs of Meldrake; she was freshly emerged from a childhood spent in Sunday School herself.

Meldrake, for his part, was strangely and uncharacteristically silent.

``If I've offended you somehow, I'm sorry," was all Glynis had to say.

``No, not at all, Avis. Such things are... difficult to capture with words, and so one doesn't often try. You understand," said the raven.

``So, how exactly did you escape? And where exactly are we right now?" asked Glynis. She thought it better to change the subject.

``As for where we are right now, you know almost as well as I do, since you flew here behind me. This is the Ravenslair, which is of course my humble home. Though it has a funny name, and though I perform some magics while here, and others from here, as it were, it is still just a humble crofter's cottage, as you've no doubt already seen. There are many others like it, but this one is mine, as the saying goes. We're in my study at the moment, which again I'm sure a smart young girl such as yourself will already have deduced from the books, scrolls, candles, and many comfortable chairs which are to be found within.

``You are my guest now, even more so than before, for just as there are certain rules of comportment that hold when one is escorting a stranger about one's own country, even more so are there additional rules regarding those one invites to become a guest in one's home, and how they should be treated, addressed, and so forth. I won't bore you with them now, since we have more pressing work in front of us, and many busy days lie ahead, filled with many preparations. To what end those preparations will bring us is still a mystery. I only know that I am becoming filled with a purpose, and strange stirrings within me have become my masters, and that I must and shall heed them. They are the product of long years spent in training, and in fact I think that you have experienced a similar awakening of purpose, if your deeds be any indication." Thus spake Meldrake the raven to his guest and friend.

``I do feel that there's some kind of purpose for me here, and I might even be beginning to learn what it is. I felt it before, but I know it now. I still don't know why I said some of the things I did, about portents and such, but I'm starting to believe quite strongly that I do have a reason to be here as well. As I said to the Silverbird and Starling King before, it's to save those children. I can only imagine how strange and alone they must feel here. Wouldn't they like to go home? Don't they miss their parents? That's what I think about, when I think about a reason for doing these things we're doing. And now my friend is also lost, though not in danger, you claim. I have to believe that," said Glynis.

``Believe it. Believe also that the things we do here, the training, will lead us to Ursus, and also to those children who are even now in the Adversary's power. And as for Ursus in particular, I think you need worry but little. I do not know the ways of badgers, but I do know the ways of Verse, and I can read both the lines and the spaces between, and for my part, I do not believe that the badger with whom I traded words was evil, or would permit evil to come to yoru friend. There is also something about this Ursus fellow that leads me to think that, before long, he will not need much protection from the likes of you or I."

``Somehow I do believe it. I was pretty upset before, but for some reason I believe now that he'll be all right," said Glynis. ``So I say: let's keep on with this 'training' you talked about, and then let's go get my friend, and those other poor children from that nasty bird. But first: how on earth did you escape from that tower?"

``Why, as easily as you might fall out of bed," replied the raven. ``As you'll recall, I began with the second part of the escape, and then followed with the first. These were, respectively: the approach to, and magical seedling attack upon, the portcullis which stood between Meldrakes '1' and '2' and the outside world (I shall hereafter refer to myself as /Meldrake-1/ and the other, the one who came for me, as /Meldrake-2/ for clarity); and my initial encounter with Meldrake-2 as I sat inside of my mathemagically-ensnared cell, wherein I heard him chanting in verse that was in fact inspired by the aforementioned Biscalar Sequence. At that time my rescuer was able to extricate me from the unpleasantness of said cell using various Arts which, though  I am now familiar with, I cannot easily describe to you here.

``Moving on from the cell door, we made our way through the halls and passageways of that level of the tower, which were surprisingly completely open to us, until we reached the abovementioned portcullis, which was in fact the exterior door for that level, and beyond which stood the open air, the green grass growing, &c. At that point he began the use of his magical seeds which I have discussed at length previously, and we found ourselves seated in the passageway having a nice bit of relaxation as the portcullis was being lifted, faithfully if ever so slowly, by the vines which had only moments before been seeds.

``Ah yes, now I remember," said Glynis. ``The way you've told the story is a bit confusing."

``Apologies, my dear Avis," replied Meldrake. ``The memory of the hallway and those wonderful magic seeds came to me first. That in turn triggered the memory of escape from the cell in the first place. One's memory is not a straight line, as you know."

Glynis did not know, since she was only twelve, and could remember almost everything that had ever happened in her life. But she didn't want to upset the nice raven, and so she simply said, ``I understand. Please continue the story."

``We were sitting in the hallway, Meldrake-2 and I. Presently, the portcullis had risen about halfway, and his pipe had burned low. He stood and knocked his pipe against the stone wall, as if to say, ``Off with us, then." At which point he walked out the door without any further ado. I had no choice but to follow, and so I did.

``Having been imprisoned for so long that, in truth, I had forgotten my own name, I was not prepared for what my eyes showed me next. The tower in which I had been living for some years was surrounded by a lake! More precisely, it was on an island in the middle of a lake, and that island was itself little more than a high stone cliff on one side with grass running up the other side, which was only slightly less steeply inclined. All around the lake were jagged mountains like teeth, and like teeth they were capped in white. The lake itself was large enough that one end disappeared around a point some ways in the distance. It was also green, and I remember to this day that I thought: /Why should this water be so green?/

``In any case, my companion Meldrake-2 was not so impressed with the scenery as I was. Presumably, he'd only just come into the tower from the outside, and was only too familiar with the surroundings. Perhaps more so than he'd felt was necessary or comfortable, since it seemed to me that an approach to this lake would be an arduous task, and to add the requirement that one attain the island tower which stood in the middle would be daunting indeed. Whatever the means by which he'd come, there was no trace of them left as we exited that door at the tower's base. No boat awaited us at the water's edge below. In fact, there didn't appear to be any sort of dock or any other sort of landing place.

``How shall we get away?" I asked Meldrake-2. When I'd seen our surroundings, my heart sank, you see. I didn't hold out much hope.

``Oh ye of little faith," replied he. ``Haven't I taken you this far? Were you not convinced by my work while you laid in your cell? Did the iron portcullis open by itself? How have we arrived here, in the open, in the light? Not by a faltering heart were we brought here. No, and neither shall fear deliver us from this island. For there is yet another challenge before us, if we would sleep in softer beds this night."

Hearing this, I was shamed, and knew him to be right. For though I call him Meldrake-2, and I am now become also Meldrake (or Meldrake-1, for the purposes of our story), I was not then what I am now. Or perhaps: I was then what I am now, but did not yet know. In either case, the result was the same. Having to acknowledge that this creature had brought me out of that fearful cell, had broken all manner of mathemagical and versorial chains which had been wrought specially for me, and having brought with him the very powers of Nature to my aid in the form of the lifting vines, he had shown me the path, the way forward, as it were. Now I had only to walk it. I resolved then to assist him as best I could, and furthermore to do so with honor from that moment on.

``What next, then?" I asked, I hoped bravely.

``As you can see, we are on an island," was his simple reply.

``As you wish, good Master, but we are birds, and blessed with flight," I said. Sometimes one needs to state the obvious.

``Do me a small favor, then, and fetch a pebble," responded Meldrake-2.

This I did without complaint or question. I was curious, I admit. This creature seemed to live inside a perpetual riddle, and each new situation was some puzzle to be solved. Given his recent exploits on my behalf, I felt I should simply do as he asked. And so I did: I handed him a pebble.

``My thanks, young crow," he replied, and then tossed the pebble in the air.

The small stone traced an arc upward, away from the island and its black tower. As it reached the peak of its flight, we heard a series of sharp ``twangs" from above. A flurry of arrows filled the sky around the pebble, nearly blocking it from our sight completely. The pebble and several dozen arrows fell into the lake's green waters below. As I turned my eyes upward, I could see dozens of crossbows being retracted from windows higher up in the tower.

``It seems we're not alone," I said to Meldrake-2.

``We never were. It's just another of the Adversary's tricks. He likes to haunt you silently, if he can, and let you believe that you are safe, that you are away. When you first discover that you are not in fact safe from his manipulations, he shrinks away yet again, the better to let you create your own monsters to fear. After all, most of your fears are greater than anything he can bring forth against you, so he's content to let you do his work for him. Then, when you've driven yourself almost wild with fear, he steps in for the easy prey you've become," replied my guide. ``Of course, it's worth keeping in mind that this is a real tower, and those are real arrows," added Meldrake-2. ``Also: the waters of this lake are chilly enough, and those mountains are high enough, especially when you freeze your bones flying over them in a storm."

``I don't suppose we can swim either," I said.

``Leaving aside the fact that, as a rule, we ravens don't swim, I'm quite sure that there are nets, or worse, hungrier things, hidden beneath the surface of this lake," he replied.

``So what shall it be, then?" I tried to sound as cheerful as possible. Cheerfulness and bravery can sometimes fly together, it is said.

``Why, a trick, a puzzle, a contrivance, a ploy!" came the reply of Meldrake-2. He sounded like he was relishing the coming challenge, and so I decided it couldn't be all that bad after all.

At that he began to chant again, in much the same way he had when he was first arrived at my cell:

#+begin_verse
/A trick, a puzzle, contrivance, a ploy!/
/O when can we play with your next wonderous toy?/
/Contraption, essence, sling and arrow/
/What have you got there beneath your barrow?/

/Cloth of Red, cloth of iron!/
/Show me flashing, cadenced fire!/
/Number's my master, this much you know./
/And with Verse at its back, a seedling will grow./

/A tree, constrained, a discipline learns/
/It drinks of earth and air by turns./
/And as it climbs to sky and glory/
/It tells one part of the Maker's story./

/If you'd write your own, and set it against/
/That of Creation, as well as Good Sense/
/You'd do well to watch what came Before/
/For many's the spice in the Cosmic Store/

/That will make you screw up your face in disgust/
/When your power, beloved, transmutes into rust./
/For it's a gentle heart that learns to wield/
/What the Maker gave freely to the beasts of the field./

/So I call on you now, Wrong One, Fool!/
/Present your malice, in the guise of a tool./
/Call forth contraption, lever, wheel/
/That I may defeat it, or dying, reveal!/
#+end_verse

Throughout the incantation, Meldrake-2's voice had been rising slowly, more and more with each line, beginning with a sort of humility and quietness, which gave way over the last stanzas to ferocity, reaching its crescendo in the final stanza. Calling forth the Adversary is no mean feat, as you might imagine, and rarely have I seen it done as it was that day by my rescuer and predecessor.

With those last fierce words, Meldrake-2 flung aside his cloak and lifted his staff into the air above his head, invoking the sky and, presumably, this Maker of whom he'd spoken (of whom I'd heard little of before, and on whom I'd pondered even less, at that point in my life).

After such an incantation, few indeed are the beings who could resist such verse-magickal forces being applied in their direction and on their behalf. Even the Adversary, power that he is and has, could not ignore the call of Meldrake-2 and his invocation of the Great Maker. So it was that we found ourselves standing before the tower for only an instant before we heard a ragged scream from high overhead, the call of a bird that was at once a cry of power and of pain and anger. Then a dark shape flung itself off of the precipice of the tower above with a speed that  I found difficult to believe, circled the tower three times counterclockwise in rapid succession (cutting through the air with a hissing sound, so great was its speed), and then crashed heavily onto the ground three feet from where Meldrake-2 and I stood. Or at least, I thought it had crashed, so great was the force of impact, but as I stood there blinking away my confusion, I found that there stood before us another bird of indistinct species, dark grey, even larger in size than we, even shaggier, whose beak and claws had a jagged, unkempt and dangerous look about them, like an unmatched set of rusty, notched razor blades. Around the creature's head was wrapped a cloth of bright red, which dipped over one eye, leaving one translucent silver orb of an eye visible, and that rimmed in bloodshot red.

I stood stock-still, cradled in awe and fear. The fat, greasy thing stood before us, large as life.

And then the creature spoke. Its voice was large, larger even than Meldrake-2's, and had, it seemed, two aspects: a harsh, deep rushing beneath, as of green waves crashing against the rocks where once a tidy lighthouse had stood watch; and a jagged whistling there was as well, that rode on the back of the deep waves, and that pierced the eardrums as if with a hot poker. Truly, I had never been so terrified in my life. I shan't forget the staccato verse it spewed forth on that day, though in truth it was long ago:

#+begin_verse
/%<<Invoke me, call down rage and power!>>%/
/%<<Traverse your own benighted hour!>>%/

/%<<Contrived, indeed, your rhymes and schemes!>>%/
/%<<Boolean shift, unwanted dream!>>%/

/%<<You'll end upon this stony isle>>%/
/%<<Your winsome rhyme, a wolven guile!>>%/

/%<<My gift to you, a list of cups>>%/
/%<<A mound of coins, to fill them up!>>%/

/%<<Divine the secret and save your blood>>%/
/%<<Weigh them wrong, and drink the flood!>>%/
#+end_verse

With that, the dreadful creature launched itself into the air anew, crouching, leopard-like as an old T'ai Chi master, before springing upward with a force so violent that its footprints, two inches deep, were left in the ground before us. And I needn't mention, I'm sure, the gust of wind created by the Adversary's departure, such that my companion good Meldrake-2's hat was nearly blown off his head! I began to get an inkling of what we were up against.

Another clue presented itself a moment later. The ground beneath our feet began to vibrate slightly, and at first I suspected supernatural, perhaps even daemonic forces at work, turning their every evil intent towards my rescuer and I, in an attempt to keep us there on that island. Such was the power of suggestion which this creature possessed.

However, as I soon discovered, the vibration in question was profane rather than sacred in its origins, as it were. For it soon became evident that there was a mechanical regularity hidden within that vibration, and something was moving. Something heavy.

My hypothesis was confirmed by observation but a moment later. Meldrake-2 and I were forced to jump back a few feet when, directly beneath the footprints left by our aforementioned Adversary, a trap door of some size swung open and outward, nearly crushing our toes in the process as it slammed into the earth with a thud.

``Let's have a look, young crow," said Meldrake-2, as he stepped forth onto the exposed timbers of the newly opened door, and from there to the edge of the opening which it had covered.

It now became obvious, what with the squeaking of pulleys, rattling of chains, &c., that we did indeed have a contraption of some description in store for us.

Just then Meldrake-2 began to back away from the opening. By now, the rattling and squeaking had become rather loud. He turned and said something to me, which I couldn't hear over the mechanical din. Luckily for me, he was kind enough to repeat himself, and loudly: ``Back! Get back!"

I did as I was told, for if a creature as formidable and skilled as he was looking to put distance between himself and whatever was coming up out of that shaft ... let's just say that I knew when to listen to my betters.

Well that I do, and did then, for what emerged from that shaft was very nearly beyond my admittedly limited powers of comprehension. Naturally, it was the very top of the thing that emerged first and, as slowly as the (apparent) systems of pulleys and chains were able to drag it up from the depths, my eyes began to assemble a picture for my brain to do its work on, and here is some little bit of what they saw: two round metallic ears had been attached to the sides of a head the shape of an inverted bucket. In fact, it appeared to be just that: an inverted bucket. A snout, also roughly bucket-shaped, though smaller, protruded from the front of the head, and that snout had cut into it a mouth of jagged teeth placed almost at random, densely, row upon row stacked one behind the other like soldiers, or rusty knives. This rough conflagration of ears, snout, and bucket-like head were themselves attached to a body which was no more (and no less) than a giant barrel, a cask for ale or wine, reinforced with iron, and of the type one might find at a brewery or winery of some size.

And the eyes! Predictably enough, they glowed a most menacingly bright red, powered by some then-secret magicks which were presumably only available to the Adversary and his ilk at that time. Since then, we've learned a great deal more of such things, and have in fact gone beyond them, but at that time it was most unsettling, most terrifying indeed. For you must understand that this was a graven image of the Protector -- there can be no doubt of it -- and what's more, this was no mere image, it was in fact a mechanical avatar, an aberration in wood and steel that, by all appearances, was designed to walk the land as the Protector Himself might have done. Everything inside of me screamed: /corruption! abomination!/

Finally, the rattling machinery had delivered its payload, which was yet another machine, and I could see the full measure of this contraption, this false being. It turned out that the legs of this creature-contraption were also of wood -- oak, to be precise -- and hinged at the joints in the common way; common also were the curved claws at each foot, though of course these were of metal rather than of bone and such, as one might imagine. Unfortunately for me, there was no need to imagine such horrors and abominations, for in fact they had conjured themselves right there in front of me. All of this that I have described came in a package that stood, by the measure of my eyes, over fourteen feet tall, or near enough as makes no matter.

I had time to make these observations thanks to the low gearing ratios of the pulleys which were delivering the platform -- and the mechanical beast which stood upon it -- to the surface. Have we spoken at all about pulleys and levers, Avis? They're quite important! But I'm sorry, I was telling you about the escape.

So, the creature was delivered to the surface where we stood, if creature it was. I stood there, in awe and rage, for this was blasphemy if ever there had been blasphemy. To think that the Protector was being mocked in this way by the Adversary in this way was too much to bear. I wasn't paying particular attention to my companion at the moment, incensed thing that I was, but one can imagine that he was feeling something similar.

And then the thing spoke.

* MARLA LOOSE IN THE REALM

* THE ADVERSARY IN THE PALE MOONLIGHT

  It had been some minutes now since John had realized his loneliness. There was no one around at all now, it seemed. Suddenly the red glow of the fires had grown darker, deeper somehow, with the knowledge that he was alone. Still and all, John was a child of the wooded North, and he knew that despite any possibly dangerous creatures he might encounter, he was safer -- not to mention warmer! -- within the hall than without. Or at least that's what his experiences with the so-called ``wild" animals from his own place and time had taught him. There was no reason to believe that the same laws of behavior would hold here, and yet one knows what one knows -- or perhaps one cleaves to the rocks upon which one has just crashed one's boat. In any event, John had, in the moments since his captor-guides' disappearance, entered the great hall and begun to explore, for lack of better things to do.

Just before going inside, however, he had taken a moment to note the orientation of the hall in relation to several constellations, which he drew neatly in ink in his pocket notebook, alongside which he wrote down the date and the estimated time of day.

Once inside, he was delighted to find that there were more carvings to admire. It seemed that these creatures -- people? -- were very much interested in carving as an art form, and a means of storytelling, which are of course the same things. Life was not delight and nothing else, however. John had lost -- or been lost by -- two sets of traveling companions in fewer days.

``Not sure what to do about this. I'm pretty sure that I could find my way back to the Smallwood gate come morning, the trail's easy enough to follow. From there, I could walk out of Halfmoon and connect with the trail back into the forest where Glynis and I first met up with Meldrake, and then to Glynis's tree. I'll wait around there for her to come back. If it's really so important to her as Meldrake said, she'll be back. I've had about enough of this adventuring, if adventuring just means wandering around and getting lost," he added ruefully.

This was not the first time John would say those words.

* APPENDIX A: CONCERNING HEXADIC AND DYADIC NUMBERS
** INTRODUCTION. THE STUDY OF NUMBER, ITSELF.

Being, in the first part, that method by which one enumerates lesser quantities in the world around us: which is to say, those quantities which can be seen in workshop, market, and the like, and thus useful in the attainment of everyday tasks and concerns.

Being, in the second part, a method by which one enumerates and thus comes to hold dominion over those middling quantities which are to be found in dealings with money and the affairs of nations, which are in actuality the same things; in particular, questions of calculation related to interest on loans, the accounts of kingdoms with respect to the bounty of its farms, and later its storehouses, by which the kingdom may thrive or go to waste.

Being, in the third and greatest part, the method by which one enumerates those questions which do not yield willingly to the understanding of men's minds, however great; these being mainly questions of the world of Nature, and the Universe Herself; to wit, inquiries into probability and chance; equations in n-variables, where n is some large number; calculations upon graphs and mapped networks; indeed, questions regarding the very essence of Number herself, Queen of the Sciences, such as the True Nature of the Primes.

All these and more can be called the realm of the Numbermaster; indeed, such questions are his playground, and all Numbers his friends. Devilishly clever friends, full of trickery and surprise for even the wisest.

** SIMPLIFICATION: NUMERIC REPRESENTATION

It is thus the aim of this brief essay to acquaint the reader with several mostly similar numeric representations, preparatory to investigations conducted via aid of the new machinery of computation.

The first step in conducting such investigations involve preparing the aforementioned numerical representations for the device's consumption (indeed, the very first steps involve gaining an understanding of the problem at hand -- that alone is more important than anything contained in this humble work! But let us continue . . .). The method by which the machinery in question represents quantity is indeed foreign to our own, though perhaps not wholly so, as we shall soon see. This is for reasons which are tied to the Device's mechanical workings which are well beyond the scope of this essay, and thus I shall pass over them here (while directing the gentle reader interested in such workings to the learned and honorable Nathaniel Morningstar's ``Treatise Upon the Machinery of Number," which despite its somewhat unfortunate title provides a faithful and detailed account of the workings of such devices as we are (at least peripherally) concerned with here. Indeed, any man who had completed the good Professor Morningstar's text and applied himself diligently to the problems set within would find himself possessed of all the knowledge required to build such a device for his own! For this reason, and for the fact of its early appearance on the scene, that tome is referred to simply as ``Morningstar." It has not, to this writer's knowledge, been yet surpassed).

In any case, we must needs return to our business, which is that of representing number in hexadic and dyadic form. In order that we approach these forms by the most direct path possible, we must travel briefly over more familiar ground -- namely, our own number system of tens.

[Figure A.0]
| Let n = 763, 436. |                   |            |            |            |            |            |            |   |
| I.                | Integer           |          7 |          6 |          3 |          4 |          3 |          6 |   |
| II.               | Powers of ten     |          5 |          4 |          3 |          2 |          1 |          0 |   |
| III.              | Expanded notation | (7 x 10^5) | (6 x 10^4) | (3 x 10^3) | (4 x 10^2) | (3 x 10^1) | (6 x 10^0) |   |


Above we are given the number 763,436, which is denoted by the letter n. Figure I is simply a representation of n where each of the integers which comprise n are given their own ``cell," as can be seen by the relationship between rows and II, wherein each integer from n is aligned with the power of ten according to its place.

Figure III is once more n, here given in expanded notation for clarity (this clarity comes at the cost of brevity of description, as can easily be observed -- note the differences between Figures 0 and III! -- but it often pays to note the obvious).

Please take a moment to perform the reduction, by hand, of the expanded notation in Figure III. It is an elementary calculation, to be sure, but one with which we must become intimate with, such that it becomes as effortless as breathing.

** A WORD ON NOTATION.

Let us refer to all those numbers which are based in tens as `decads,' and denote them with subscripts, e.g., 245_{10}.

Let us then refer to those numbers based in twos as `dyads,' and denote them 11001_{2}.

Thus the number in its current `base-n' representation is subscripted by the number upon which it is based, and confusion is avoided.

** FIRST POSTURE: DECADS to DYADS.

Let us begin by examining the dyadic system. To make ourselves understood by the machine, we'll want to begin with translation, the act of converting from decad to dyad ("base-ten to base-two," if you will). What follows is an example:

Given n = 25, convert to dyadic notation.

Let b = 2, which is the base we desire.

Let x = | |, which we'll imagine as the beginnings of an array (or list) of ``cells," each of which can contain one number.

STEP ONE.  We begin by dividing the number under consideration (`n') by the number representing the base we desire (`b'). Thus, 25 / 2 = 12r1, which is to say 12 with a remainder of 1 (fractions are unwelcome here, since the machine does not understand them)[1]. Therefore, we push the remainder 1 onto the array x from the left-hand side, such that the array `x' now looks like this:

x = | 1 |.

Since 25 / 2 = 12, we use 12 as our new `n' in the next iteration, leading us to . . .

STEP TWO.  We've replaced 25 with 12, but the rest of the calculation is the same. 12 / 2 = 6r0, and thus we push 0 onto the array `x' from the left side so that its appearance is now:

x = | 0 | 1 |.

STEP THREE.  n = 6, and 6/2 = 3r0, necessitating that 0 be pushed onto x, yielding

x = | 0 | 0 | 1 |.

STEP FOUR.  Our new n = 3, and 3/2 = 1r1. Thus 1 is pushed onto x.

x = | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |.

STEP FIVE.  n = 1, and 1/2 = 0r1, providing

x = | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |,

which is normally written as 11001, though for purposes of clarity we shall denote it 11001_2.

Note that this operation required five steps, since the binary representation of 25_10 is five digits long. Such translations from one base to another are rather tedious and time-consuming, and for that reason they are best done by machine (once one has acquired a firm grasp of the fundamentals, naturally).

** SECOND POSTURE: DYADS TO DECADS

Given the array x above, we can see that each cell can contain either a one or zero, and that those numbers correspond to `states' which we might call `on' or `off'. When a one is inserted into a given cell, the result is that we must calculate the value of the number contained by that cell; this is based upon its position in the array which denotes its exponent, which is in turn affected by its base of representation. For this example we are interested in dyads, or ``base-two" representations.

[FIGURE A.2]

| Cell `state'                |   1 |   1 |   0 |   1 |
| Exponent                    | 2^3 | 2^2 | 2^1 | 2^0 |
| Base-10 Value for each cell |   8 |   4 |   0 |   1 |
