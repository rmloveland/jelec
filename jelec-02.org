* HALFMOON

``What's your name?" The badger was asking John for his name again, snarling it, really. In fact, several of these unhappy badgers surrounded John at the moment, though it was only the largest and fiercest which spoke. The rest seemed content to merely wait for John's answer.

While contemplating exactly what sort of answer he'd like to give, it occurred to John Sharp that badgers were in fact rather frightening creatures. Sharp claws and razor teeth were in evidence, as was the sheer size of them. The badgers in question were all as tall as John himself, with the exceptions of his sole interrogator, who was even taller.

These badgers had arrived shortly after Meldrake's verse incantation had knocked Glynis, John, and the first badger they'd encountered (the one who had studied Verse) to the ground. The hawk had not fallen as a result of Meldrake's incantation, however, and John had been amazed at how quickly things had happened after that. Meldrake had taken to the sky with the hawk in hot pursuit close behind. After a moment's recuperation, Glynis had regained her feet and transformed to the Whitehawk right before his eyes, to John's amazement. Though he had seen it already, he was by no means used to it yet: the sight of his friend's fingers stretching towards the sky, becoming longer and thinner; her chin receding, shrinking away as her nose grew, and grew some more, and acquired a sharp, hooked point; feathers sprouting from her skin like plants from a garden's soil, covering her fair skin; her hazel eyes shrinking into amber stones, the eyes of a hawk; these and other things did he see. It was in fact quite a lot for a young mind to handle. Perhaps it was /only/ for a young mind to handle...

``Damn your name, then!" cursed the badger casually as he turned to his fellows. ``Go on, grab him, then!" And back to John: ``It's alright, you won't need a name where you're heading, youngster. This one's going to headquarters, " he added for the others there, and it seemed to John Sharp that the others nodded knowingly, including the Verse Badger (as John had taken to calling him in his own private speech). The Verse Badger, as it turned out, was smaller than the others here, lighter in color, and observedly less fierce. In fact, he had been pushed to the outer edge of the circle which surrounded John at the moment; clearly, he was a youngster or small for his age -- it did not matter which, really.

``Sir, what does headquarters want with this creature? With respect, of course . . ." Thus came a question from the Verse Badger himself, the effect being that of a disembodied voice emerging from behind a wall, in this case the wall of badger flesh and fur in front of him.

``Never you mind, poet," replied the largest badger (whom John had taken to thinking of as ``Big Boy" --how quickly we seek out names for people, places and things!) to the smallest. ``It's well above your pay grade. Perhaps you'd do better to mind your own business: books about poetry and feelings and such," he added.

This last brought a round of laughter and derision from the rest of the group. ``Poetry," said one with a snort of disgust.

``Very well, sir," replied the smallest badger. The words themselves were respectful, but John thought he detected a hint of petulance in the tone. ``Not surprising, really," he thought. ``It's no way to treat one of your own fellows, not if you want to get anything worthwhile out of him." And then: ``I wonder if this is the infamous Holcredt Consortium?  Would explain all the funny armbands. I wonder what the point of it all is."

``Enough talk. On to Halfmoon!" Thus ended John's little reverie with Big Boy's orders, which of course meant that John was meant to be roughly grabbed and shoved into some position, configuration, etc. for the journey.

``Second," said Big Boy to another of the badgers there, a rather dark one with rough fur, ``take this prisoner and another badger and make for Halfmoon, post-haste. You'll probably have to carry him. From what I remember these two-legged creatures are not much for speed. The rest of you, with me!" And with that, he and the rest of the badger cohort headed North, in the direction which John and company had come from. John noted that the Verse Badger had been the one selected by this `Second.'

Presumably, the others were off in search of Meldrake and Glynis, or some signs thereof. John thought it was unlikely that they could do too much to help in a search for birds in flight, and so decided they were probably a general patrol of some kind, though he couldn't really see the point.

``Come on, then," said the Verse Badger to John after the larger group had left. ``Let's go to Halfmoon. It's a lovely town, really, perched right on the Long River, it is. Got its own bridge, too, and all sorts of folk coming and going from the docks. Might be you'll like it."  John was surprised to see that the other badger did not rebuke or scold the smaller one, but merely laughed. ``Alright, little brother, let's go; you can bring your new pet," said the large, dark one called `Second.'  The badgers had a good chuckle at that, and a true chuckle it was, all good nature and mirth. It seemed that the malice had left their little group along with Big Boy.

Seeing this, John was emboldened enough to ask, ``What's in Halfmoon? Is that where headquarters is?" and then: ``Couldn't I just go back to my friends?"

``No, I'm afraid you can't go back to your friends. Likely you couldn't find them anyway; they've flown off, and you're stuck here on the ground, like us. As far as Halfmoon goes, it's a pretty little river town, but it's not where Headquarters is. That'd be long leagues south, so you're in for a hike," said the Verse Badger.

``Will you be bringing me there?" asked John.

``Looks that way. I've always wanted to see this HQ anyway," said VB, and his brother nodded.

There wasn't much else to say at that point, and John Sharp was never one for saying much else anyway, and so the three of them continued along the winding path along Long River's edge, leaving the deep forest further behind. John could still see the edge of that same forest creeping to the edge of the fields some good ways away to the east, as if it were following alongside him, which was comforting in its way. John had always been a creature of forest rather than field, and found his solitude there alongside his joy. Open fields and farms were pretty enough, but in the end it was the trees he loved, the dark evergreens especially and most of all.

The path continued South, wending its way around large oaks and maples that grew along the river. Whether they'd been planted by wind and chance or by some long-ago wise farmers, John couldn't tell. In either case, they served as a nice windbreak, in addition to holding the soil along the riverbank together. They were a hedge against erosion by wind or water, and judging by the condition of these farmers' fields, they'd done their work well. The soil had changed from an acidic, sandy grit inside the evergreen forest into a somewhat darker brown as they'd travelled south. The soil upon which they walked was apparently suited for apple trees, corn, and perhaps some wheat, at least as far as John could identify wheat. It was definitely something from the wheat family, though.

Finally the cultivated fields began to give way to small groups of cottages here and there as they passed. Most were made of whitewashed stone and mortar, with green shutters and thatched roofs. Gardens there were, fenced in from the animals of the forest and field, filled with vegetables that John was pretty sure he'd recognize from his own life. Maybe not, though. Even so, the sight of cottage and garden cheered him, as it always had. ``Maybe this won't be so bad. I'll make the trip to this `Headquarters' with these badgers, and I'll have a bit of adventure. Then I'll go looking for Glynis and Meldrake. If anything, I'm easier for them to find than they are for me. They can fly up on me at any moment as I'm walking along, so I'll let them do just that. Until then, why not explore a bit?" Bold thoughts from a twelve-year-old, but then, perhaps not. Who can remember their twelve-year-old self, and how brave that person was, compared to what they are now? It was the same with John.

As they'd come South, the river had grown wider and deeper. The cottages in the fields to their left grew larger and more numerous, and finally they saw it: a stone wall which could only have been Halfmoon. It was probably fifteen feet high, with a wooden door reinforced by iron, and the path upon which they stood ended abruptly there. To the right, they could see the bridge stretching across the river, though it was some ways downriver from the wall. Where the bridge met the river's opposite bank, there was a stone tower. Presumably it defended the bridge from, well, whatever it is that towers are meant to defend one from.

``Who goes there?" A voice from a slit above the door had the temerity to ask.

| ``Why, 'tis I, the Badger of the Sunlit Field, |
| And I might command this door to Yield!        |
| Were I you, And on the Other Side,             |
| I'd set aside my Foolish Pride,                |
| Open for a pair of Halfmoon's sons,            |
| Returned from the Forest with a Stranger One,  |
| Than even you have seen, good Sir!             |
| Arise! Unlock! Awake! Bestir!"                 |

Thus did the Verse Badger gain their entry to Halfmoon. Oaken door groaned open, and John and his captor-companions strolled in. The wall through which they walked was several feet thick, and above their heads John saw some trapdoors. ``What are those, I wonder?" asked the young man from Lake William. ``Why, they're holes from which to dump boiling oil, the better to scald the hides from our flesh," came the Verse Badger's casual reply.

``Oh. That's nice," replied John.

``Nice if you're from Halfmoon, of course," offered Verse Badger. ``And how shall we address you, Sir? Give us any name you please, for how else shalt a Badger tease?" John was beginning to like this fellow, in a strange, you've-captured-me-but-at-least-it's-rather-jolly-and-interesting-so-far sort of way.

``And why should I give you my name, after you were shooting those needles at my friends?"

``Oh, that foolishness? That was just for show! That fat old badger is so serious, so we give him a hearty `Yes, sir!' and put on a good show of it now and then, but that's all it is, just a bit of fun, really. Why, not one badger in that group wants anything to do with hurting anyone. It just makes the old coot feel better to have some young ones to order around, marching up hill and down dale, all in a day's work, you know. The old fellow would have nothing to do all day without his patrols. Never mind the fact that there's nothing that needs patrolling against!"

``Oh no! We're surrounded by corn and vegetable gardens! Oak trees, and trout! Which of them will attack us first?" wondered the one called Second. It was the first time John had heard him speak.

``You still haven't answered my question." John was determined to get an answer, however flippant.

``We weren't even aiming at them! That's what I'm trying to tell you! Halfmoon has been at peace for hundreds of years. There's no reason for all this belligerence. It's ever since the old man got involved with this HOLCREDT business, I'm afraid. Those fools see threats in every shadow; thankfully, there aren't many of them. Just another group of folk with nothing better to do. Everyone needs a hobby, you know." And with that the Badger winked at John, or at least John would have sworn he did. Who's had a badger wink at them before? And how would you prove it?

John decided to let his frosty reserve melt just a bit. The Verse Badger's words had the ring of truth to them, since there was so little guile in them. He also laughed too much, and his laughter was all mirth and no cruelty. John decided he believed him. ``You can call me `Ursus,' if you please. And how should I address you?"

``I am known as Vellus to most, so you may call me that. Don't think you've won anything through a name, however. This is but the outermost ring of my powers, if you catch my meaning."

John did not, or not really, at least. He only knew what Meldrake had told him: don't give anyone your true name.

``Ursus is the bear. Are you a bear? I know a few, and they are not so small as you. They smell worse, and their claws are deadlier. Perhaps you'd like to meet one of them?" Vellus the Verse Badger was nothing if not accomodating, anyone could see that.

Just then they emerged from the tunnel through the wall into the sunlight. What John saw was a delight. Cobbled streets lined with trees, and all manner of strange creature and folk to stroll them! The main street of Halfmoon was much like those that John knew back in that other place that he called home, which is to say, Lake William. Of course, it wasn't Lake William, anyone could see that, or even a mirror of Lake William. In any case, the buildings ran alongside the street, several stories tall. Sidewalks ran in front of them, and trees planted every so often gave them shade. Shops and (presumably) restaurants filled the ground floors of the buildings -- some of them even had signs John thought he could almost read! They were written in a queer language whose letters resembled English, but of course it wasn't English, not really. After trying to read the signs for a moment and realizing he was lost, John gave up. Better to take in the rest of the scene.

As noted above, there were creatures and folk going about their daily business along those tree-lined sidewalks. And the streets! Filled with carts, and creatures darting between them to cross the street (no crosswalks here, John noted), the street was crowded with carts of all shapes and sizes. Presumably they were delivering to and from Halfmoon all sorts of victuals, vittles, trinkets, magical amulets, books, produce, meat, spices, salt, and more. John could smell some of those things as he stood, dumbfounded, with the badgers at his side.

Many of the carts were being pulled by oxen, just as one might imagine; John was surprised (though he shouldn't have been by now) to hear them talking to each other, and their drivers! ``But of course," he thought, ``Why shouldn't the oxen talk? Everyone and everything else does! I suppose the trees will be talking next, we haven't heard from them yet."

Little did Young John Sharp know as he spoke those words.

``Come now! Wake up, look lively! We're off to see a friend of mine, and maybe ours." Vellus had let John look long enough, and standing in one place when one is in a bustling town just won't do. ``We'll see if you still want that name of yours in a bit," added the badger with a toothy grin. It made John a little uneasy, since (good-natured or no) a lot of sharp teeth were visible when Vellus grinned, and even though badgers didn't eat humans so far as John knew, sharp teeth on a creature that size will tend to make one a bit uneasy.

Second might have sensed that uneasiness. ``Don't worry, lad, where we're going it's perfectly safe, even for hairless creatures with no teeth like yourself. Meaning no offense, of course," he added. ``It's just that we haven't often seen your like in the Realm. Most everyone here is a creature of land, air, or sea, with the appropriate fur, feathers, claws, beaks, horns, etc. So you can imagine we find it a little curious how you lot could defend yourselves, survive."

It was obvious to John that Second had never visited the world of Men.

And so they set off on a little journey through the streets of Halfmoon, with Vellus in front, Second bringing up the rear, and poor John trying to keep pace as he was jostled between. The brisk pace meant that John experienced the next part of his time in Halfmoon as a bit of a blur. More tree-lined, cobbled streets, more creatures filling them, more signs in that queer ``almost-but-not-quite-English" that made his head swim. Turn left, turn right, walk briskly to corner, turn left again. These were as many words as Vellus uttered, muttering as he glanced back and forth between the street and a scrap of paper (or what passed for it), all at a brisk march. It seemed that he'd been given directions by this ``friend," and they were all three of them at the mercy of that slip of paper, or so John thought.

And just when John had begun to tire of yet another street, yet another line of oxcarts, crowds, not-English signs, and the like, Vellus drew to a halt. This meant, of course, that John ran squarely into the back of him, since he was in the midst of walking just as fast as his (admittedly) rather short legs would let him. John thought it was rather like walking into a wall (a fur-covered wall, that is).

They found themselves at the edge of a queer sort of park. Open fields skirted the front edge of it, where the sidewalk ran along the street, which acted as a buffer of open space between the busy streets and the woods of the park itself. Of course, John had no way of knowing that it was a park, or if it was, but what else could it be? One can only interpret new information in terms of what is already understood, and so he understood it as a city park.

``This looks like a park. Reminds me of the park back home in Lake William," John managed to get out (after having recovered from his impact with the fur-covered wall that was Vellus, of course).

``'Park,' eh? Well, here we'd call it a smallwood. Though it probably amounts to the same thing," replied Vellus.

``Wait a minute. Why did you need that piece of paper with directions to find it? I thought you were from around here," said John Sharp.

Vellus and Second looked at each other.

``Smallwoods have a way of moving about a place, didn't you know that? Or do all your 'Parks' just stay in one place?" asked the Verse Badger.

John didn't know what to make of it, so he remained silent.

Vellus replied to his silence with a nod. ``In any case, we've arrived. Our guide resides within, and here we are without! Let's march ourselves up to the gate, and give the fool a shout!" It seemed that he was in the mood for some rhyming again.

They left the sidewalk and continued up a footpath lined with uneven stones. As they crossed the field and came closer to the `smallwood,' John could see that there was a wooden gate across the path where it entered the wood. ``Is there nothing in this place," John thought to himself, ``but that it doesn't have a gate of some sort in front of it?" He thought it best not to share such questions, of course.

As they approached the gate, John could see that it was set in an arch, also of wood, carved with strange letters that he didn't understand. They were different from the ``not-English" of the signs in the town, though. In addition to letters, there were other carvings, lining the arch and the edges of the door in what we would describe as a `knotwork' pattern. The surfaces of the door itself were both carved and painted, and depicted scenes of small, dark creatures engaged in various activities. Or so one imagined, from a distance of twenty yards.

The images grew clearer as they made their way closer. ``Bears!" thought John. ``Bears!" Realizing what was carved on those doors, he was both excited and afraid. Each door was carved with three scenes, arranged vertically. The lower panel showed what were obviously cubs, little roly-poly creatures all in a pile, wrestling around as cubs are no doubt wont to do, and all the while Mother looked on from not-far-away. John thought that she was probably enjoying the play of the cubs, but there was also a note of defending them there, a fierceness that said: ``Come no closer."

The second, middle panel showed a great tree, and in the high central branches of that tree was a bear, presumably there to gather whatever fruit or honey from beehives had drawn him or her there. The picture was an amazement to John, for although he knew from reading books that bears could climb trees, he had never seen any pictures of such things, much less seen it in life. And yet here it was, carved in relief and painted, a bear clambering around in the upper branches of a high tree! Rather exciting stuff...

The third and highest panel John saw last. Since the gate was so tall, let's say eight feet or more by our measure, his eyes fell naturally to the bottom panel, and then rose to the center. But now, having seen those lower panels, he turned his eyes to the highest panel of the carved wooden door, and what did he see there? Why, only this:

Two huge bears faced off against each other. Clearly a fight or contest of some sort was about to take place. Between the two bears stood a massive, gnarled tree, the branches of which filled the sky of the carving and, in fact, covered it completely. Beneath its massive span and thick trunk, the bears beneath looked rather small, though John had no doubt that, were he to see two such bears in person, preparing for combat, he'd be quite afraid. Which was no doubt what he should be feeling right now, approaching the lair of what was apparently a bear or group of bears, right here in the middle of a bustling town. And from the looks of things, they didn't really want visitors.

Even the loquacious Vellus, the Badger of Verse himself, seemed somewhat cowed (or was it awed?) as they approached the high oaken gates. Second, usually not one to say much, kept his own counsel as usual. As did John. Vellus merely turned to John, and said quietly (if rather sharply), ``Mind your tongue here, as I will mine. Friends or no, they can be fierce!" And with that, fear or no, caution or no, the Verse Badger drew himself up to his full height, steel in his spine, and raised the brass knocker that hung from the heavy gate. One, two, three times he knocked. The sound the knocker made as it struck the brass plate behind it rang across the field over which they'd walked. It seemed to affect the dark forest ahead queerly, however, and John could have sworn the sound didn't travel more than ten feet or so before failing.

The sound of that knocker's ring could have lost its courage, after all. Upon entering *that* forest, filled with *those* creatures, one could hardly be blamed for losing heart. Even if one were an inanimate wave of sound. For the bears were widely known in the Realm, and feared, not because they were killers, per sÃ©, or particularly vicious (certainly they were no more bloodthirsty than the birds of prey, or vicious than an aroused badger, for example), but because of their sheer greatness of size, and also, one must imagine, because of how terrible a creature of that size can become when aroused to anger. For size does matter, in some things, and the rage of a giant beast must exact its own terrible price on those within reach when that rage comes.

Perhaps more unsettling to the other creatures of the realm was that there was no way to determine when a bear might attack. In some cases it was largely a matter of the bear's personality and personal inclination, and thus there was no way to predict it. This is not to say that all creatures in the Protector's Realm did not have their own personalities, thoughts, and feelings, for of course they did, and to claim otherwise would be folly. Even so, the bear was known as a creature of strange moods rather than predatory impulses, and most thought it the better part of wisdom to simply stay away. For what reason would a badger have to consort with bears? Or a raven, for that matter, or a starling or rabbit or wolf? Of all these, the wolves were the only land animals that did not fear the bears, which is to say: would engage in battle with them from time to time, usually over a freshly killed carcass. We might style it more neutrally as a `confrontation', though for a wolf it is more akin to a battle than a hunt, when dealing with a creature such as a bear.

Then there was the matter of the smallwoods, which is to say: Magic. For the smallwoods were forests that *moved*, and travelled from place to place throughout a city or town. They were known as the only way for bearkind to enter or leave a town, or at least: the only way they *would* enter or leave. And how could a forest move from one place to another, you ask? How could it travel from town to town, or (as also happened) from one place within a town to another, and all this without the town's residents seeing or hearing a thing, waking up on Thursday and finding that Wednesday's forest in the park on the south edge of town had become Thursday's forest on the north end? We simply don't know, as they don't, and there are some such things that we cannot know, the mysteries of bears perhaps being one of those mysteries among many that the universe holds. Or perhaps not, and one day we'll know how it's done, see the gears and nuts and bolts of it, so to speak, and say: ``Oh, we knew it all along! No Magic about it!" All very easy to say, of course, once we've learned how a thing is done, we who couldn't dream up how to accomplish that thing in the first place. In any event, we must call the moving forests of the bears `smallwoods', and we must admit that, for our purposes here, and according to our understanding, they are the true Magic.

None of this was on young John Sharp's mind, however, as the clang of the brass knocker at the bear's gate rang through the air. There was no other sound that John could detect, and as far as he could tell nothing was moving in forest or field. Vellus stood statue, with his brother Second beside him. They had said they had a friend here, but it was hard for John to imagine that a creature friendly to them was about to appear from behind the gate. Though John had to admit that of the scenes carved on the door, the first two had been peaceful enough, and the second one, with the bear up in the tree, could even pass for humor.

Just then they all three heard something large moving behind the gate. They could hear its breathing. A snort came, that turned into a kind of growl or throat noise. John stood stock-still and prayed (not for the first time, and not the last) that he would find a way through this, as a large body bumped against the gate from behind.

John heard the rattling of heavy chain against oak. Three seconds later, the door began to swing outward from the stone arch.

* THE TUTOR

"It doesn't work," said the novice, a young man of 13. Tall, though slight and pale, with a rather nondescript mop of brown hair, he was but a middling student at the castle. Indeed, he was one of those most often found here in the head Tutor's office seeking assistance from his elders. Even so, he received only middling marks from his superiors. The study of number did not come easily to all those chosen by the Master of Red and Black, it seemed. And yet here he was again, seeking to learn. What else could a teacher do, but teach?

Known mostly as "Spark," he was not known for the quickness of his mind among the other students. One had to wonder whether that nickname had been given to him by the other students as a cruel jape, since he was hardly the brightest light to shine forth from the Dark Tower. Or even the sixth-brightest. Oh well. Hopefully he hadn't seen the cruelty in their dry humor and had merely taken it as a compliment, a name meant to denote his skill in taming the elemental forces which were required in order to make the new computing machines work. Or so the Head Tutor hoped as he considered the boy across the table. He hoped above all that the boy would remain oblivious to their jokes and cruelty, and keep working. And yet...

Would that all of my charges were as curious, even those whose intellectual gifts are greater. No, he reminded himself, especially those whose gifts are greater. For in the study of number, and indeed of the new computing machines which had recently grown therefrom, diligence and curiosity often outstripped raw ability. Many were those who had been given the Gift at an early age, and squandered it as their dimmer peers eventually surpassed them through hard work (or serendipity, which is just one of its effects). Often it seemed that their Gift was a curse, which of course is true of most gifts that allow one to get away with doing less than his or her peers. Indeed, there are no gifts, only things that cost. Everything costs, in the end. The sword with which you slay the dragon today may cut your own throat tomorrow. And so on. And yet here he is again in my office, this skinny creature with no real ability, just refusing to quit, refusing in the face of all his mediocrity to slink away defeated and leave the field to his intellectual betters.

"I spent all last night trying to figure out what was wrong with it, and I have a few ideas. I wrote them down." The boy pulled out a piece of paper filled with unintelligible glyphs. What are these, the marks of chicken's feet? thought the Tutor. And I don't understand that messy-looking diagram over there on the left.

"Alright, young master. Let's see what we have here. I see you've chosen the dodecadic representation?" The boy nodded yes. ``Very well, let's get this into some kind of order, shall we? I see, in this corner, a diagram of sorts? Are these the signal roads you'd like the E.F. to travel?"

The boy nodded again. Signal roads were a difficult concept to master for some, the Tutor had to admit. He had had some difficulty when he'd started to learn them as well, though not near as much as this young one. No matter. The material must be pounded through thick skulls as well as thin.

"Source, earth... yes, yes. Wait, what's this?" He pointed out a glyph that straddled two signal roads where they crossed (lines on the paper, really, and rather ugly, wavily drawn ones in this case, clearly by an unsteady hand). Rather than give him an answer, ask a question. "What does this do?"

"Well, I put that there to raise the Emotive Force along that road, but ..." The boy frowned, and didn't speak for several long seconds. Finally even his meager intellect was able to distinguish what the teacher was saying, and he realized his error. This one, at least. "Of course! I raised the Emotive Force, but at the cost of rising Impedance! Continuity of Flow remained the same, of course, but it was no longer enough to overcome the Impedance! Thanks, Tutor! I guess it's back to the drawing board. I only hope it's ready by the next moonturn, since that's when the next Evaluation begins." With that the young boy scurried out the door of Acutus the Head Tutor, presumably back to the little workbench he shared with two other Acolytes in the common study rooms.

Acutus' own rooms were little better, though he appreciated them just the same. Situated as they were in a single cylindrical tower, the various Acolytes, hangers-on and advisors to the Master of Red and Black (or ``M.R.B.") were allotted rather limited floor spaces, since all rooms in the tower were cross-sections of a "doughnut" shape created by the central stair that ran up the innermost area of the structure. Because of this, the status of one's rooms were determined by how high and how small they were, since to have a larger room meant to be further from the seat of power, as well as to have a diminished view. Thus Acutus was well-pleased with his location in the top third of the tower, and certainly the view from his windows out to the surrounding mountainsides was stunning, absolutely stunning. One paid for that as well, however, with chill. This high up, the wind never stopped blowing, and so arrangements were made for heavy, shuttered windows, thick velvet curtains, and of the course the fires were kept burning at all times.

Acutus yawned. It was too early in the morning for an aging bird like himself to be dealing with these strange creatures, these so-called "humans" from another world, that seemed so important to the tower's Master. As a young jay, long before the ascendancy of the Master of Red and Black, he had studied at the Rookery in Halfmoon, which for many years had been the main seat of higher learning in the Arts of Number, renowned throughout the Realm of the White Bear (Jelec, the Protector, Honored be His Name, Red His Tooth and Claw). Acutus had earned high marks as a young blue jay fresh in from the forest, and for long years after that had tutored at the Rookery himself, in addition to travelling throughout the realm while pursuing his own studies and research. From time to time he would visit other Numbermasters living throughout the land, sharing their hospitality and company, not to mention the use of their libraries whenever he could. Upon his return to the Rookery from one of his famous trips abroad he would give a lecture, or series of same, sharing what knowledge he'd gathered with his fellow seekers after wisdom.

Much had changed since the arrival on the scene of the Master of Red and Black, however. Acutus was no longer a scholar in residence at the Rookery in Halfmoon; he had been called away two years ago by the Master of Red and Black, with the Rookery's own Headmaster serving as catspaw. Always a jealous old creature, that Headmaster. Acutus must have seemed a rival to him, and so he was sent away. Acutus was to take up a new position, he'd been told, at another castle away to the South, somewhere in the Kettle Mountains. Once there, he would become the head Tutor (which meant he would assume the duties of a Headmaster without the associated pay), and his charge was to design the curriculum of a new school of Number, training new Numbermasters. It was what he felt he was born to do, and to be appointed by the Rookery's Headmaster to open a new school, well, it was supposed to be a high honor, and yet it had left a bad taste in his mouth somehow.

For one thing, he'd never heard of this "Master of Red and Black" fellow, and for that reason alone he had been suspicious. Who was this person, and what had he done that he could convince the Rookery's Head to open a new school just for him? For all the years of his life, Acutus knew, as did every other Numbermaster in the Realm, that there were only three schools for those who would wrestle with the mysteries of Number. Halfmoon was largest and oldest, trainer of the most able teachers and researchers. Aerie was smaller, a single tower in a monastic setting high in the Barkshire Mountains to the East of Halfmoon, long leagues away and surrounded by endless miles of the Black Forest. Her students went the way of Combination, which was to say those mysteries of counting and chance.  Finally there was Northwatch, called by some Norwich, a mighty castle in its own right, originally raised by the early Bear Kings in the Frosted Hills south of the Rondak Mountains. Fewer visitors made their way there, though the journey was no longer than that to Aerie. Some said it was the cold and snow that kept visitors away, others that it was the queer ways of the Northerners. Whatever the reason, it was known as a lonely place. Northwatchers ("Norritchers" in the peasant tongue) traveled the road of Fluxion, which was to say the essence of Change. Curves, their slopes and the areas beneath were what they sought. A worthy study, truly, and honorable, Acutus thought. Many of the mysteries were connected by the study of Fluxions, and connected to it as well.

Indeed all three Houses of Number had distinguished themselves with honor, there could be no denying. For as long as those now living could remember, there had been these three homes and refuges for the study of Number and her mysteries. Now there was a fourth, struggling to be born amidst the wilderness. Acutus knew that it was not worthy of inclusion with the others, and wouldn't be for hundreds of years at least. Even then, it would always retain title as the newest House, and as such would remain the younger sibling of the others, ever having to prove its worth. For now it did not even have a proper name, which was all to the good, Acutus decided. The other Houses of Number would scarce be aware of its existence for some years yet, since he was sure that the Rookery's Headmaster hadn't troubled himself overmuch to inform the others of Acutus' whereabouts. For whatever reason, the old stork had wanted him gone, and for good.

"So be it, then," he had often thought. "I'll raise this House myself, and it shall become Great. Let the other Houses tremble at the mention of the Dark Tower and its mages, wizards of Number itself but also of the new Counting Machines that will extend their powers over the whole earth!"

Such had been the goal of Acutus during his fervor at the discovery of the Counting Machines. What a wonder, after all! A machine that can perform calculations for you, can compute the trajectories of the moon and stars, search tirelessly through veritable haystacks of numbers for just the one you need, the right one that makes answering your question or solving your problem that much easier! Or at the very least: a tool that would extend one's reach, would allow one to grapple with ever greater and greater mysteries of Number, Knowledge and the Universe!

Of course, the machines were still large, fragile, and somewhat error-prone. Their understanding of numeric precision still left a great deal to be desired, and they required teams of highly trained Numbermasters and Acolytes to massage their inputs and outputs. For all their promise of infinite possibility, their opening up of doors into the halls of cosmic power, they were still only machines that had been conceived of and created by fallible creatures of blood and bone. Still, they represented a technology in its infancy, and one which the general public was hardly even aware of to boot. Little did the commons know what delights the future held in store for them! And as one of history's great and almost-forgotten Numbermasters, that inimitable black bear known simply as SchneeBear, was quoted as saying: ``Technology always gets better; it never gets worse."

Acutus had envisioned a world where the Numbermasters, rather than serve the ambitions of warriors, as they had for so many years, would serve the people. For centuries the various Orders of Number had earned their place in the Realm through service, first to the ancient line of Bear Kings, and then to the various lords and masters that had sprung up after those early kings had disappeared. The world had changed since then, though. Kings and battles, blood and valor had given way to farming, trading, a life of peace and plenty. Now instead of a countryside filled with bustling castles, keeps, and holdfasts, it was farms, cottages, humble folk plying their trades, making their way through life as gracefully as they could.  Humble folk who needed the protection of the rule of law, not some ancient Bear King's long-dead words. Meanwhile, in many places, castle, keep, and holdfast stood empty, and most people were happy to have it that way.

And of course that was why the Master of Red and Black had always hated for it to be called the Realm of the White Bear, a feeling he and Acutus shared. For though there were bears in the world, just as there were other creatures (from Aardvark to Zebra and beyond), the dread White Bears had not made their way below Rondak for many generations now, and whatever trade they plied in those vast, icy wastes was of no concern to those within the Realm (or whatever it would soon be called, with the advent of this New Age they were building).

Thus it was time for the Realm to move beyond woods magic and dead kings, and to embrace the rule of law and civilization. Bright civilization, Redcloth called it!--

Acutus caught himself at that mention of the Master's common name. One never knew when the Master might be listening in. If not him, one of his shadows. It was best to comport oneself in one's own mind as one would in public, Acutus told himself. Yes, that was best.

* A LADDER TO THE STARS

  ``And so it was that I found myself traveling in the company of a large raven. In fact, the raven in question was as tall as I was (which is to say: around six feet or so). He had discovered me in the dungeon of Redcloth's tower, and had brought with him, in addition to bread and water (O Joy! O Bounty!), a selection of magical items which, he assured me, would make our hasty exit possible. Naturally, I was overjoyed to hear this, since I was at that time unable to work any magics whatsoever on my own behalf. It was my hope that his large size and rather fearsome staff of ash (with its appropriately large head of meteor-rock), which he referred to as the ``Staff of Forgetting", would be adequate to secure our release.

  You can imagine my dismay upon learning that his plan for rescuing me involved, not the heavy staff with which he was armed, nor his aforementioned formidable size, but a pouch on his hip, from which he drew several scrolls of sheepskin (or a similar material, since I cannot know for sure), upon which were written mere words and symbols! Disaster! Of course, little did I know back then that these were the true tools of his trade, and more dangerous they turned out to be in the end than any longswords or warhammers. But that is a story for another time, perhaps, for in fact, the very manner of my escape was to depend upon one of these scrollmagics. For this raven and I found ourselves at the end of a long tunnel beneath the great tower. Presumably it was built for drainage, since its distinguishing characteristic was a trough, several inches deep, which ran down the center of the stone floor, creating two `lanes', as it were, and upon these we traveled. We stood there, looking out at the freedom which awaited us mere inches away... through iron bars!

  And what did this black stranger do? Did he call down the mighty powers, which I now know that he had at his command? Did he invoke some terrible spirit from beyond our little mortal coil, whose mildest wrath would tear down that dread tower, terrible as it was in its own black way, block by obsidian block? Did he conjure a $VERSEMAGIC that, in its poignance and elegance of phrase, in its bombast and gravitas, its vivacity, would rip Redcloth and all his avatars from this plane of existence with the force of seabourne gales?

  No, no, no, and no. He muttered something and pulled from the aforementioned pouch at his hip a smattering of tiny seeds, which he tossed nonchalantly onto the stones at the floor of the tunnel. He then withdrew one of the scrolls I've just told you about, and he spoke a few simple lines which, even to this day, I remember well:

| For each of you, seeds numbered 1 through /n/,     |
| Please help my friend to taste freedom again.      |
| Until you meet an obstacle, grow up straight,      |
| Branch left and right once you meet that gate, and |
| Naturally, branching, do the same as before,       |
| A tree at each tip, your roots in the floor.       |

  With that, he reached into his pouch yet again, and brought forth a clear flask. I must assume that it was filled with water, but it was like no water which I had ever had the pleasure to see or taste, for as soon as he had sprinkled it over the seeds, he motioned for me to step back a few paces. And a good thing he did so! For no sooner had I done as he'd bid than the first shoots emerged from those seeds and began burrowing into the stones in the floor. Presumably, they wanted each to secure a proper footing before beginning their upward growth. I could hardly believe my eyes as I watched them quite literally `shoot' up from the ground and meet the iron bars, which, as it turned out, formed a portcullis. Just as the raven's verse had requested of them, the vines (as they now clearly were) grew to the first bar and branched in two, forming a `V'. Each arm of this `V' then wrapped over the bar, at which point the arms met, and each grew around the other in brief embrace, after which time they continued growing ever upward, finding a new partner with which to continue the dance at the next level. In this way they grew upward and outward, each shoot becoming vine and then thick branch, until at last they had covered the entire portcullis of iron in a sort of regular ``web" pattern or latticework.

  [Figure 13.0: FRACTAL TREE/PORTCULLIS DIAGRAM]

  At that time I began to notice a slight groaning and creaking. It was the sound something makes when it hasn't been moved from one place for a very long time. For the branches of the raven's few seeds had reached their full growth and strength, and now they began to push implacably against the weight of the portcullis. It began to move upward, so slowly that it was almost imperceptible to the eye.

  Now, I must admit that I began to feel some anxiety at that point, since I was, in fact, still technically a prisoner of Redcloth's dread tower, and on that count very little of substance had changed, since I had not even got out the basement door yet! And so, unselfish fellow that I am, I turned and shared these feelings with my new friend and would-be rescuer. ``Friend", I said, ``you've done lots for me so far, and I am of course very grateful, but I remain troubled since, for all your work, we're still in the basement of the same tower in which I woke up this morning, and not very many steps away from the cell where I slept, as it happens. I've no doubt that you're a brave and hearty fellow, and that, should the alarm sound and dozens of my captors come pouring out-of-doors to guard this entrance from the outside, or some such, you would do your bravest best, but 'twould avail us little, as I think you know".

  And so he turned to me and said, ``All that you've said is true, but in fact our true difficulty lies in front of us, not behind. For the malice of Redcloth is a subtle malice, full of tricks, traps, and puzzles. I've no doubt this simple business with the portcullis will be looked back upon with a fond nostalgia once we've seen what awaits us beyond these walls".

  ``And yet you don't seem to be in any particular hurry", I replied. ``Why is that? Aren't there going to be guards coming? One might imagine that a tower this size has many and more. Yet you don't seem concerned at all."

  ``Mere guards are of no concern to me. Nor would they be to your captor. For he and I were trained at the same schools, by the same masters, and as such mere physical conflict, constraint, or restraint interests us little. Knowing this, he guards his tower against his real enemy, who was once a friend. For the most dangerous enemy was always once a friend. Otherwise, how could he hurt you? Only a friend would know where best to aim his sword. For that reason, I know that guards are not our challenge here. The contest is with your captor himself, and our weapon is the same as it was ever (and shall be for ever) where he is concerned: the mind. Therefore we should worry ourselves but little over guards and swords, and rather more over traps, tricks, and puzzles of logic."

  I was, to understate, quite surprised, and not entirely happy to hear this news. ``Wait. You were once friends? I don't understand. How is it that you're here to help me now? Why? What do you stand to profit from this?"

  ``Profit is of no concern to me, I have the whole world given to me. As do you, though you do not see it, friend. As for the story of my friendship with your captor, that is a long and arduous tale, with twists and turns and the love of a woman, madness, and all the ingredients which go into the cooking of such a stew. As such, we haven't time for it here."

  At that I was silent. I supposed that I would rather be rescued, and hear the tale another time (preferably in a nice warm pub, with the fire blazing and a cold pint in hand), rather than hear the tale now and thereby disrupt the rescue. I wasn't reassured, however, since the revelation that my supposed champion was in fact a friend of my (still-nearby!) captor did but little for my general sense of well-being. Not knowing this strange raven from a hole in the ground, as the saying goes, I had little reason to trust him, save for the fact that I had rotted in that cell for Protector-only-knows how long, and this creature had been the only one to care, evidenced, of course, by the fact that he was the only one who'd shown up.

  During our conversation the vines covering the portcullis had rendered it nearly invisible; in fact, it now resembled nothing so much as an ivy-covered wall, since there was not even an inch of iron visible through the now-leafy vines. Nor was any light coming through the bars. Meanwhile, the slight groaning sound the portcullis made as it was being pushed up had continued, so that there was now perhaps an inch between the floor and the bottom of the gate.

  My anxiety, as I've said before, was growing by the second, despite my new friend's reassurances, or perhaps because of them, and so I found myself staring intently at that gap, tracking its maddeningly slow progress with a watchful eye. So watchful, in fact, that the eye in question (my very own!) was beginning to twitch.

  ``Have you considered wiggling your toes?" Thus came the voice from the corner behind me. I jumped a bit at the sound, nervous thing on the verge of escape that I was, and saw the raven, now sitting on the floor. His back was against the wall, and he was smoking. In the now-mostly-dark corridor (growing lighter by the millisecond, thank The Protector!), I could see the raven's face lit by the red glow of his pipe. By this time I was tired of calling him ``the raven", and so I asked simply: ``What's your name, Friend?"

  To which he replied: ``I carry several with me at all times, for use at need. In this part of the world, I go by Meldrake. But more importantly: Have you considered wiggling your toes?"

  ``Whatever for?"

  ``Combined with a few deep breaths, I hear it's quite therapeutic. All the rage these days among the consciousness-focussed wellness troupe. You know: biofeedback, meditative states, accessing the combined genetic wisdom of millions of years of your forebears via the collective unconscious. Surely you've heard about this sort of thing?"

  I had to admit that I hadn't.

  ``No matter. You're of course free to discard or reuse my third-hand advice as you see fit. Though I, for one, recommend a good toe-wiggling from time to time."

  Though I had no idea what this character was on about, he had at least distracted me from my worries, if ever so briefly.

  ``Perhaps you'd like to have a seat with me, and watch the sunrise?" With that, he nodded towards the opposite wall, where there was now a band of light along the wall's bottom edge, where the door had allowed it in.

  I decided to sit with him and watch that sun rise, and of course I wiggled my toes around some for good measure. As the good raven had implied, the tension within my feet was enormously strong, and had been causing me much pain, though I hadn't realized it before.

  We sat there for perhaps twenty minutes more, ``watching the sun rise" thanks to the work of those magnificent seeds. He with his pipe, I with my earnest toe-wiggling. And breathing, too, when I remembered to do it.

  During that time I thought about several things. First, I imagined what manner of traps and tricks lay in wait for us as we made our way past this (likely) first and easiest obstacle of our journey from the tower. Or rather, I spawned a thread of worry that ran constantly in the background and ruminated upon such topics, thereby freeing my conscious mind for more interesting (or at least useful) work.

  Second, I spent a little time thinking about what, if anything, I'd do with my life if I ever got out of here. I quickly backgrounded that process as well, attaching the label: `UNPRODUCTIVE'. You see, I have a way of thinking about my thoughts that gives me the impression that I am in control of them --or at least, I have the impression of managing them, which is comforting and even sometimes useful.

  Having sent those uninteresting topics to background processes (as noted), I brought my attention to the present. And what did I know or notice about the present, now that I had backgrounded (hereafter referred to as ``bg'd") the usual currents of anxiety, idle future wonderings, &c.? It turned out that I knew several things:

  First: that I had just been freed from my (very small) cell by the raven with whom I now travelled, by a process that was itself duly fantastical in nature, and thus worthy of recollection for your benefit, you who are the faithful listener of this tale. Second: that cell had been hermetically sealed, i.e., had had magical protections placed upon it, in several forms, to wit:

  Verse magicks (a.k.a. ``Versorial" magic): poems and songs that, in their intent, were designed to keep me from ever leaving that room, or, barring that, would visit terrible misery upon me and mine, should I ever find a way to leave. These were placed within the walls themselves during the room's construction. More precisely: verses had been composed and transcribed onto strips of cloth, which were then baked into each individual brick laid into each wall, to include all of the floors and ceilings.

  In addition, the door to my cell was built of black oak. It is difficult for me to impute the meaning of this to you if you are not, in fact, a resident of the lands where Jelec (The Protector, Honored Be His Name) holds sway, but let it suffice to say that the black oak is a rare and beautiful tree, one that hides deep in the forest, and which has properties -- that is, ways of disguising itself from intruders. Who are these intruders? Why, creatures like us, who do all of this unnecessary moving, running around, shouting, and general noisemaking! We alternately furry or feathered oafs, alive for this fleeting moment only! Well, the black oak (and all other trees, for that matter) are highly attuned to the movements of mammals, noisy noisemakers that we are. I'm sure you don't need me to tell you that trees are quite literally ``plugged in" to the earth itself, and as such are privy to her moods and mysteries in ways that we who live a few brief years upon her surface cannot imagine.

  Finally, as you may have gathered, there are some of us here (you are among them, I think, Good Avis!) who happen to have special relationships with certain species of tree which, again for reasons which I do not understand, allows us to tap into those elemental magics to which I've just referred. The black oak is mine. As such, I could never harm it, or any door (since we are in fact discussing a door, as I recall) that is made from it. Can you harm your brother, your sister? No more could I visit harm upon my cell door. In fact, I loved that door, since I could sit in front of it for hours and just /be/. Unlike the bricks which lined my little prison, the door was not filled with any malice for me, in the form of nasty spells or otherwise. It was simply a heavy door, reinforced here and there with black iron. Black iron over black oak. Such was the cunning of my captor, for he knew this well: that the best way to imprison someone is to build part of their cage out of something they love. Never forget that.

  In any case, lest you think my imprisonment involved only the ``mere" verse magicks to which I've alluded, let me continue. For what would the world be without numbers? Those old friends of mine and yours! Yes, my adversary is exceedingly clever when it comes to the Art of Number, more so than I could ever dream of! And therein lies the other part of my prison:

  Number magicks (a.k.a. ``Mathemagics"), which take the form of various mathematical facts or puzzles, encoded in a number of ways obvious and non-. For instance, the first series of puzzles I discovered involved dyadic number sequences encoded in tilings which ran around the soffits along the ceiling. Solving these would lead to still further clues, emplaced in other areas of the room, which would lead to still further, and so on. It reminded me of the old joke about the dictionary definition of recursion:

  /Recursion/, n. See /Recursion/.

  What, you do not know what recursion is? We shall have to remedy that, my dear Avis. Yes, indeed. For now I can tell you that to recur, one must have a recurrence, that is: things happen again, and again, and again. Do you see?

  Yes, where was I? Oh yes, recursion, number magicks, &c. The walls of my cell. Dyadic and hexadic numbers were everywhere! As a matter of fact, that brings me to the nature of my escape from the outer tower, which I'll return to telling you about in a moment, if you'll but permit an old fool his ramblings. But first, what were some of the other number tricks and games in my cell? Well, I can tell you that the brick pattern on both floor and ceiling were of what I'll call the `seashell' variety; I call them that because the pattern in which they were laid resembled a seashell! Here, let me draw it for you in the dirt. Yes, over here by the fire, please. Come closer, don't be afraid. Here it is:

  [Figure 13.1: BRICKS LAID IN GOLDEN RATIO/SEASHELL PATTERN]

  So there you have it. Both floor and ceiling were laid with bricks in this way, those same malevolent bricks which were filled with spells against me. Overhead /and/ underfoot. I can't tell you how many hours, how many nights I lay awake staring at that ceiling, plumbing the depths of that pattern, of those bricks in that configuration. I spent years with them, and of course I'd like to think I got something out of it other than my current insanity, but you'll have to be the judge of that, since it's a matter for another time.

  And the walls! How could I forget the walls? When I wasn't laying awake at night staring at the ceiling, I was staring at the walls. They were laid in yet another pattern, a very fetching seven-pointed `star' pattern, as a matter of fact, and one which I'll draw for you as well, though of course you don't need me to show you what a star looks like:

  [Figure 13.2: BRICKS LAID IN STAR PATTERN]

  Even so, I suppose you must admit that this was a rather curious-looking star, and in fact it has some strange properties, this ``heptagon", as it is known.

  (Incidentally: at this point, you might be wondering why it is that our world, or reality, or realm, or branch on the great cosmic tree of life, or what-have-you (which is called the Land of the White Bear (Honored Be His Name), in case you've forgotten somehow), is filled with a people whose speech you can understand, and who use a vocabulary that is familiar to you. Indeed, why should these strange creatures from another reality be using words to describe the things in their world which are clearly based upon the English language, and which have Greek and Latin word roots, stems, suffixes, and the like? Why, the answer is simple: we are not in fact using those words, stems, suffixes, roots, and so on, based as they are upon historical events which are not of this place and of which we are nearly entirely ignorant! Instead, it is the habit of your mind to translate our speech as such, for each of us can only understand inasmuch as she can translate things happening around her into a form which is easily digestible for her own way of thinking.)

Needless to say, I was rather flattered that the dread Redcloth had had a special room built just for little old me, and that he had gone to all this trouble in general. Of course, that prospect held little real joy, since it meant that I was now trapped in a room in some drafty, cold tower, with no freedom and without even the ability to read the books I wanted, or to write or receive letters. For one who would live a life of the mind, this is ultimate damnation. At least until you realize that your mind is the book. Or alternately: books are pale shadows of mind, one mind as it existed at one moment in time.

  Returning from digression now... right. So how exactly did I escape from that horrid place? I'll tell you. Just hold in your mind that there is a version of Meldrake and one of me, sitting in that hallway or tunnel beneath the tower, idly smoking pipes and wiggling our toes, waiting for our good friends the vines to finish raising the portcullis which separates us from the outside world. Please place a mental bookmark there, since it is where we must needs return to forthwith. First, however, you must know how it is that I came to be outside my cell in the first place. And again, I must tell you: via the skill, courage and cunning of the redoubt Meldrake!

  Perhaps I praise him too much. In any case, I was, as you now know, held prisoner in that specially-constructed magical cell for time out of mind. I forgot who I was, or how long I had been there. As it happened, I was meditating upon one of the many and varied mathematical puzzles which were in evidence all around me, as was my habit, and suddenly I heard a whisper. I, who had not heard the sound of a creature's voice in --what was it? Months? Years?-- and here I was, hearing whispers. In that situation, the first thing one does is say: ``I'm probably going mad, and this is but the first step down that slope". After all, one doesn't just sit around by oneself hearing whispers all day!

  Or perhaps one does. So as I sat thinking, I heard whispers, and those whispers were difficult to hear, but I could conjecture after a few moments that they were some sort of verse. Someone was chanting a verse! At that time I had no choice but to believe that someone, some new dark sorceror who was Redcloth's favorite pet of the moment, had come down to the dungeon to have a bit of fun with me, casting a spell upon me to give me a boil upon my bottom, you know, that sort of thing. Of course, there were few but the one we call Redcloth himself who would have had the ability to do me any harm, for most of those who would call themselves ``sorceror" or ``versemaster" or ``numbermaster" were, in fact, nothing more than fools trifling with great mysteries. To be fair, those mysteries are such that few even among the wise understand. And I am by no means among the wise!

  Therefore I decided that there was little chance of some flatterer having made his way down into the bowels of the tower, and so I began to wonder: who else could it be? Over time, and by mustering intense concentration, I was able to discern but a few lines, of which I'll repeat a small part here:

| grass. (1)                                                               |
| milk. (1)                                                                |
| sour! (2)                                                                |
| brick by brick, (3)                                                      |
| flower by flower, (5)                                                    |
| black oak, iron, parchment, power! (8)                                   |
|                                                                          |
| I call upon you now as the Son to his Father: (13)                       |
| (mortar, stoneways, parchment, bother!) (8)                              |
|                                                                          |
| Burn the Tree of Life where we all began, from cavespeech to mountain    |
| to querulous plain. (21)                                                 |
|                                                                          |
| 'Twas for nought if a child in the darkness lays, there's nought in Good |
| if Good this stays, and Good hath nought to teach these Days --          |
| If true, and can't we hope for isn't?                                    |
| When was the last the Protector listen'd?                                |
| Who knows, for the old were then young at that!                          |
| Mortar, stoneways, parchment, drat!                                      |

  The whispers kept on going like this, fading in and out of my hearing, each verse getting longer and longer. From time to time they would `return to zero', so to speak, and begin again from the same place, though as you might imagine they would travel in slightly different paths at first, and the paths traversed by those verses as they grew and grew would diverge more and more, until they had wended their way into topics and territories new and strange, completely different from those which had come before.

  Of course, this structure, once heard, can be imagined to be the product, not only of great effort on the part of the VerseMaster, but of the world itself. Note that it begins so simply, with a word. Much like our Universe, some believe. Then there is another word, another single syllable. Then a word of two syllables, followed by three syllables, and so on. This is in fact also tied to a mathematical sequence which has been known in these lands for many years, and which has many interesting properties.

  I did not know all this instantly at the time I heard those rhythmic whispers in that cell long ago, but slowly over a period of hours, as the chanting continued, I was able to gather information, and in fact I was rather in awe of this creature who could compose such a verse, in real time, as it were, and whose command of number and verse together were strange and unknown to me. Of course, there are those who exceed in the narrow and sometimes austere way of Number, and those who travel freely the winding path of Verse, but few there are who tread with one foot upon each. So this was a very strange creature indeed, that I discovered outside my cell on that day.

  And what of that sequence? Well, let me describe it for you: it is in fact simplicity itself, such that even a child can understand its basic operation. Let us begin with 0. Adding 1 to the previous number, we have 1 again. Add 1 and 1 to make 2. Add 2 to the previous value of 1, and you have 3. 3 and 2 are 5.

  Let me draw this out for you over at the table. Yes, do come on over here with me, please. Don't mind that stack of books, but do mind the candle. Yes, here's a nice blank space on the vellum for me to write upon. Yes, where were we? The sequence. And so:

  |   1 |
  |   1 |
  |   2 |
  |   3 |
  |   5 |
  |   8 |
  |  13 |
  |  21 |
  |  34 |
  |  55 |
  |  89 |
  | 144 |
  | ... |

  And on and on and on...

  This sequence has a special name here. As it is quite well-known among the society of Numbermasters in our world, I can only assume that it has been given a name in your world as well. Do you know what it is? No, I suppose not, young thing that you are. Here we call it the ``Biscalar Sequence", which is to say: ``the ladder built of two", though in this case we are concerned with a ladder that scales to the very stars. For this sequence has some quite explosive properties indeed. Perhaps we would be best served by a picture? Yes, let me draw it out here, in the corner. And do fetch another sheet of vellum from that cabinet over there. The mahogany, yes.

  Let's begin with a circle to represent each digit, like so:

  [Figure 13.2: STACKED CIRCLES: FIRST FIVE NUMBERS IN FIBONACCI SEQUENCE]

  As described, each number in the sequence is the sum of the two preceding numbers. Which of course you can see from the list of numbers I wrote above. What are some of the properties of this sequence, however? Now you will catch a glimpse of the Numbermaster's Art, and what goes into it: no less than the constant questioning of all! Especially where number series are concerned, there are several essential properties to be aware of, and for each property there are several questions we must ask (Note that these we discuss here are by no means exhaustive, but are merely an introduction, my dear Avis, and the gentlest at that).

  Often series of numbers are referred to as /sums/, or can be thought of that way. And one of the most important qualities of sums are whether they are /convergent/ or /divergent/, which is to say: as we keep adding/subtracting/doing-Protector-knows-what to the elements of the series, do they shoot off toward ∞, with the sum growing ever larger and larger and larger? (I'll give you a hint, or more precisely, the same hint I already gave you, and tell you again that the ``ladder of two leads to the stars", which is an old bird's silly way of saying that it heads ever upward towards ∞. That is to say, it is a /divergent/ sum. It is also, incidentally, an old peasant saying about the value of marriage, which is rather funny, I think.)

  This is easy to see with our beloved `ladder' (here, I'll write it straight across -- might be a bit clearer this way, in case you hadn't got it before):

  | 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 5 | 8 | 13 | 21 | 34 | 55 | 89 | ... | ∞. |

  Clearly, this is a creature that climbs ever higher and higher, into the very topmost branches of the World Tree! No one can hope to contain such a beast for long. Try to chase it and you will quickly tire. Try to describe the /n/ th item in the sequence (for a large value of /n/), and life quickly becomes difficult (unless you are in possession of a mechanical aid, of course, but that is a discussion for later, my dear Avis. You aren't ready yet!).

  As for /convergent sums/, they tend to hover more and more closely in and around a certain value, which is (again) to say: each term in the series adds less and less to the total, and so it ``converges", or comes to rest, around a particular number, which some unenlightened creatures refer to as the `answer'. But naturally there are no true answers for an inquisitive mind. Only ever and always new questions!

  An example of a convergent sum? Very well, then you shall have it, and in fact, it's right here in front of you. Or perhaps one should say: we're very close to it. As you've just seen, the Biscalar Sequence is an infinite sum (or divergent, if you prefer). Therefore, if we attempt to sum all of the terms in that sequence, we quickly shoot off into the blue, grow spiritually fatigued, question our place in the universe, the meaning thereof, &c.

  However, if we sum the /reciprocals/ of the sequence, we meet with another result entirely.

  You've had reciprocals in your schooling, haven't you, Avis? I'll recap quickly, just in case.

  Given a number /n/, place it in the denominator of a fraction. Let the numerator of that fraction be 1 (which is also known as /unity/, which is quite a beautiful way of describing it, don't you think?). Let me write out a few examples for you, just so:

  |    n | 1/n     |
  |------+---------|
  |    1 | 1/1 = 1 |
  |   13 | 1/13    |
  |   42 | 1/42    |
  | 1257 | 1/1257  |

  Note that the reciprocal of unity (1) is itself unity (1).

  As I was saying: if we sum the reciprocals of the Biscalar, we go from the Biscalar itself

  | 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 5 | 8 | 13 | 21 | 34 | 55 | 89 | ... | ∞ |

  to the sum which is known as the Reciprocal Biscalar Constant.

  | 1/1 | 1/1 | 1/2 | 1/3 | 1/5 | 1/8 | 1/13 | 1/21 | 1/34 | 1/55 | 1/89 | ... | 3.3598... |

  This is just a rather scary-sounding way of saying ``a single number which is created by summing the reciprocals of the Biscalar Sequence".

  Written together, the picture becomes a bit clearer, and of course one should pay special attention to the rightmost values (that is, the sums).

  |   1 |   1 |   2 |   3 |   5 |   8 |   13 |   21 |   34 |   55 |   89 | ... |         ∞ |
  | 1/1 | 1/1 | 1/2 | 1/3 | 1/5 | 1/8 | 1/13 | 1/21 | 1/34 | 1/55 | 1/89 | ... | 3.3598... | 

  I hope I haven't bored you with this rambling on of mine, Avis. We haven't known each other for very long, after all, and I do tend to go on so. Oh, no I haven't? Well, I don't believe you, for after all you are a very nice young girl and of course I would expect that you're just far too polite to admit that you're stuck in this room with a strange old creature like me, listening to me ramble on about mathematics and other foolishness! Perhaps it's time I got back to my story?

As I was saying, this sequence we've just been discussing corresponds precisely to the syllabic structure of the verse spells that Meldrake was chanting outside my cell when he arrived, thereby informing me that the creature with whom I would soon be dealing was in fact a reasonably powerful VerseMaster and no mere flatterer or pretender to same, and it explains to you, I hope, the combination of elation and trepidation which flooded over me at that time.

I had been sitting and listening to the chanting of this creature for some time, and had completely lost my focus on anything other than the rhythmic chanting of his voice. After some time it had become rather hypnotic, you see. Presently it stopped, and I heard the owner of that same voice step towards my door, and then he spoke: ``Stand in front of the door."

I was very near the door, but was seated, as I've said. I stood and positioned myself directly in front of the door as this stranger had asked. Were it some mere brawler or swordfighter who'd given me that order, I might have balked, supposing that such a one would soon come crashing through that door and onto me. However, I had by now seen (or is it heard?) enough evidence that this fellow was trained in the subtler Arts that I deduced that he must know enough about trees and creatures and the connections 'tween that this would not happen.

As for what happened next, it's difficult to explain, or even to describe. Have you ever noticed a sound hovering just at the edge of your hearing? It's so faint that you have a hard time distinguishing it from silence, and you only realize a bit later that what you were hearing was your own blood as it rushed through the veins in your ear. Well, as I stood there behind that door, waiting for what I hoped was my rescue, I began to notice something like that. It began as a low hum coming from the other side of the door, but before many seconds had passed I perceived that this sound had grown somehow, and was now in the room with me as well.

In fact, before many seconds had passed, I knew that the sound was coming from inside me, and from my diaphragm in particular. I was humming the sound myself! And this was no `strolling through the woods on a clear day' sort of humming, either. More like: an elemental vibrational force that was emerging from my body, and the frequency I was emitting matched that which came from the other side of the door and joined with it, filling first my belly and chest and then the room around me!

After this synchronization had been reached, my partner beyond the door and I continued our monotonous duet for two or three minutes' time, during which I felt that we were communicating via these sound waves in some way that I don't really understand. Gradually the sound from behind the door grew less and less, and I was obliged to match it. Within another minute or so, we had finished, and I stood there trying to understand a feeling of great contentment and peace which was now filling my body.

And what's more, I found myself standing in the hallway outside my cell door.

* THE SMALLWOOD

``Welcome, friends." The voice that emerged from behind the gate was deep as a mountain. Though its words were friendly words, that voice had a language all its own that spoke of deep forests and things not to be trespassed against. The door was now fully open, and John could see the brown hulk that had stood behind it. He craned his neck to see the broad face and murderous snout, from which those friendly words had emerged, and realized the reason for the height of the arch. The bear stood on its hind legs and surveyed them calmly; John wished like anything that he could read the facial expressions of bears, but he supposed that the lack of bared fangs reassured him somewhat. 

``I see you've brought a new friend", said the brown bear.

``Indeed we have. And how does this day find you, old friend?", asked Vellus, the Verse Badger.

``Bright sun outside. Cool, dark forest inside. The Long River beside me, teeming with fish. What more should a bear want from the world?" It seemed obvious, to hear him say it.

``A fair point. Would that we were all so grateful for a day in the Realm. I'm sure you remember my brother, who is called `Second' by some, though he was the first in our litter. As for my new friend, I'm sure the two of you will get on famously; he is called `Ursus', and comes from a strange place very much like and unlike our own. This you can guess, I think". With that he pointed at John, who gave the bear a nod. This was a silent gesture that he had learned from watching his father's dealings with other men, and it seemed appropriate here.

``Ursus." The bear paused. `` I have seen his like before, travelling with the grey wretch. Small things, though I admit that they know some magics."

``I'm sure you're right, though this fellow is newly arrived here, and rather a different creature altogether from that lot, I dare say."

``One hopes".

John Sharp was not entirely sure who or what they were talking about (e.g., Who was the ``grey wretch"?), but he had learned, again from his father, that often it was best not to ask questions and make oneself a nuisance generally; rather, the best course of action was usually to listen, learn by seeing, and to see only what was there, and not what you wanted to see. This method was generally more trustworthy, even in John's limited experience, than listening to voices coming out of mouths (a phenomenon otherwise known to John's father as ``hot air"). Talk fell under the same category as all of those other things that John's father mistrusted, along with feelings, emotions, desires, and so on, up to and including people who didn't keep their pocketknives clean and sharp. Even more untrustworthy were those who didn't carry pocketknives at all.

John supposed that the bear to whom they were speaking did not carry a pocketknife, unless of course one counted the dozens of sharp teeth and claws at his disposal. He was pretty sure that his father would allow for such an exception, were he present.

Meanwhile, pleasantries dispensed with, the bear turned and dropped to all fours, moving aside that they three might pass. Once they had stepped inside the gate proper, the creature rose again and closed the heavy doors, chaining them once more against the town.

John stood and looked up at the pines. This was an evergreen forest, a good /northern/ forest, there could be no doubt about it. Even more so than the country he'd traveled through with Glynis and Meldrake, this place reminded him of the forests surrounding his home back in Lake William. The sunlight glinted through openings in the canopy of pine and spruce branches, and the ground was covered in red needles. Ferns grew everywhere between the trunks of the taller trees, and the smell of pine, pitch and needle, hung in the cool air.

It was, John decided, a place of great peace. He instantly began to relax. Even so, his thoughts turned to Glynis. ``Will she and Meldrake ever be able to find me, here on the forest floor? How could they see me?" He wasn't especially worried about his safety --after all, Glynis was in more danger than he-- so much as about losing track of his friend in this strange, great wide world.

``Well, we've quite a trip ahead!" All thoughts of reflection were dismissed immediately upon any occasion when Vellus opening his mouth. ``I do so enjoy a nice trip abroad!"

``How long do you think it will take?" asked John. He wanted to see how Vellus would answer the question.

``Hopefully, not long at all", was the badger's reply. ``Via the smallwood, what once took weeks can be travelled in days. Once arduous journeys are accomplished with relative ease. Naturally, that ease is purchased by our friendship with the bears, which is a precious thing which few have earned. Note, young sir", he said, turning to look at John, ``that I said /earned/, not /purchased/. There is no gold or silver in this world that will sway a bear. It isn't that they're incorruptible, it's just that money is about as useful to them as a pinecone to you or I, which is to say: it's a cute little thing that I might find along the forest path, but it serves me not in any real way, and thus has no real value."

"Gold and silver are of no importance." The brown mountain could speak as well as amble along the path.

``You'll do well to remember that," Vellus reminded John.

"Only life is important," added the bear, whose name John still had not heard yet.

John decided to be bold and to ask: "What is a name I can know you by, Sir Bear?"

"It may be that you never know me," came the reply. "But if you would do so, you can begin by calling me ARCTORYX. I have lived in the north as a youth, and of late I have toured far afield in the smallwoods. I have achieved the rank of CHARTOPHYLAX, which means that I am a keeper of scrolls."

After that, the bear said no more, which came as no surprise. ``I suppose I can ask my questions later", John thought to himself. ``Or maybe my eyes will get the answers before my mouth", he thought. ``Either way, I've got to get myself oriented, and get a handle on where I am and how to go about finding Glynis." He decided the place to start was to begin tracking the movements of the sun, its rising and setting, as well as the directions in which it did so. ``After all, I don't have any reason to believe that there is an `East' or`West' here, but I guess I'll use those words anyway. If I can figure out where I am and where I've been, I may be able to map out just where I'm going."

So it was that John settled on the idea of becoming an amateur astronomer, though he might not have thought of himself that way. He had a little notebook in his front pocket, and a pencil that he could sharpen with his pocketknife, and so counted himself lucky. Here were his first scientific instruments (those, and his mind). Now he needed a way of determining direction.

By now it was approaching late afternoon. John's best guess, based on the shadows in the forest, and the spare light coming down, put the time at around five. So far the length of the days seemed to be about what he was used to at home, which gave him some hope that the sun's movements would prove to be, well, similarly similar. Indeed, as the small troupe continued through the evergreen forest, the sun's rays entered at an increasingly steep angle, until they appeared to be entering from the side, and from time to time would even shine into one's eyes. Contrasted with this sudden brightness, the rest of the forest grew ever darker. There were of course pine trees all around, many growing to heights of what John guessed was about 60 to 70 feet. They provided a canopy of sorts, under which John could see stands of spruce, wet areas dominated by red or ``swamp" cedar growth, and of course the indomitable birches which lined the small open meadows and other open areas, such as those along several streams they passed. Or was it the same long stream? John decided that this was most likely, or rather that it was unlikely that there would be several streams in an area with almost exactly the same characteristic width and rate of flow. Yes, the birches. They were always the first trees to recolonize an area that had been lost to the forest. Those which grew here were whiter than any John had ever seen, much more even than those he knew from his home. Gone were the patches of grey and black bands which lined the trunks of many of the trees he had known. These were unblemished and stunning.

Beneath all this, there was the ubiquitous carpet of red needles and various small flora of the forest floor. Most important of all these were the humble ferns which throve amid complementary blankets of moss. Thus was the forest floor divided among a few states, each equally beautiful: covered in a blanket of red pine and other needles (this described the path upon which our little group travelled); almost invisible under a symphony of bright green ferns, gentle harpsichords strewn about the forest floor wherever there was soil enough to meet their humble needs; and wherever needle and fern failed, such as upon the large rock outcroppings which were everywhere inside the smallwood, there grew the tenacious yet fragile green moss that John loved, that said to him: ``You are in a real forest now; be at peace."

* ACUTUS MEETS WITH REDCLOTH
* CUPS AND PENNIES

Presently, the portcullis had risen about halfway, and Meldrake stood and said, ``Off with us, then."

(``I'd hoped to stop boring you with these Number bits, but it seems that I can't tell the story without them, since they are in fact integral to the way that I escaped!" -- adapt the `binary cups' puzzle from Merrill)

* APPENDIX A: CONCERNING HEXADIC AND DYADIC NUMBERS AS UNDERSTOOD BY MACHINE.
** INTRODUCTION. THE STUDY OF NUMBER, ITSELF.

Being, in the first part, that method by which one enumerates lesser quantities in the world around us: which is to say, those quantities which can be seen in workshop, market, and the like, and thus useful in the attainment of everyday tasks and concerns.

Being, in the second part, a method by which one enumerates and thus comes to hold dominion over those middling quantities which are to be found in dealings with money and the affairs of nations, which are in actuality the same things; in particular, questions of calculation related to interest on loans, the accounts of kingdoms with respect to the bounty of its farms, and later its storehouses, by which the kingdom may thrive or go to waste.

Being, in the third and greatest part, the method by which one enumerates those questions which do not yield willingly to the understanding of men's minds, however great; these being mainly questions of the world of Nature, and the Universe Herself; to wit, inquiries into probability and chance; equations in n-variables, where n is some large number; calculations upon graphs and mapped networks; indeed, questions regarding the very essence of Number herself, Queen of the Sciences, such as the True Nature of the Primes.

All these and more can be called the realm of the Numbermaster; indeed, such questions are his playground, and all Numbers his friends. Devilishly clever friends, full of trickery and surprise for even the wisest.

** SIMPLIFICATION: NUMERIC REPRESENTATION

It is thus the aim of this brief essay to acquaint the reader with several mostly similar numeric representations, preparatory to investigations conducted via aid of the new machinery of computation.

The first step in conducting such investigations involve preparing the aforementioned numerical representations for the device's consumption (indeed, the very first steps involve gaining an understanding of the problem at hand -- that alone is more important than anything contained in this humble work! But let us continue . . .). The method by which the machinery in question represents quantity is indeed foreign to our own, though perhaps not wholly so, as we shall soon see. This is for reasons which are tied to the Device's mechanical workings which are well beyond the scope of this essay, and thus I shall pass over them here (while directing the gentle reader interested in such workings to the learned and honorable Nathaniel Morningstar's ``Treatise Upon the Machinery of Number," which despite its somewhat unfortunate title provides a faithful and detailed account of the workings of such devices as we are (at least peripherally) concerned with here. Indeed, any man who had completed the good Professor Morningstar's text and applied himself diligently to the problems set within would find himself possessed of all the knowledge required to build such a device for his own! For this reason, and for the fact of its early appearance on the scene, that tome is referred to simply as ``Morningstar." It has not, to this writer's knowledge, been yet surpassed).

In any case, we must needs return to our business, which is that of representing number in hexadic and dyadic form. In order that we approach these forms by the most direct path possible, we must travel briefly over more familiar ground -- namely, our own number system of tens.

[Figure A.0]
Let n = 763, 436.
| I.   | Integer           |          7 |          6 |          3 |          4 |          3 |          6 |   |
| II.  | Powers of ten     |          5 |          4 |          3 |          2 |          1 |          0 |   |
| III. | Expanded notation | (7 x 10^5) | (6 x 10^4) | (3 x 10^3) | (4 x 10^2) | (3 x 10^1) | (6 x 10^0) |   |


Above we are given the number 763,436, which is denoted by the letter n. Figure I is simply a representation of n where each of the integers which comprise n are given their own ``cell," as can be seen by the relationship between rows and II, wherein each integer from n is aligned with the power of ten according to its place.

Figure III is once more n, here given in expanded notation for clarity (this clarity comes at the cost of brevity of description, as can easily be observed -- note the differences between Figures 0 and III! -- but it often pays to note the obvious).

Please take a moment to perform the reduction, by hand, of the expanded notation in Figure III. It is an elementary calculation, to be sure, but one with which we must become intimate with, such that it becomes as effortless as breathing.

** A WORD ON NOTATION.

Let us refer to all those numbers which are based in tens as `decads,' and denote them with subscripts, e.g., 245_{10}.

Let us then refer to those numbers based in twos as `dyads,' and denote them 11001_{2}.

Thus the number in its current `base-n' representation is subscripted by the number upon which it is based, and confusion is avoided.

** FIRST POSTURE: DECADS to DYADS.

Let us begin by examining the dyadic system. To make ourselves understood by the machine, we'll want to begin with translation, the act of converting from decad to dyad (``base-ten to base-two," if you will). What follows is an example:

Given n = 25, convert to dyadic notation.

Let b = 2, which is the base we desire.

Let x = | |, which we'll imagine as the beginnings of an array (or list) of ``cells," each of which can contain one number.

STEP ONE.  We begin by dividing the number under consideration (`n') by the number representing the base we desire (`b'). Thus, 25 / 2 = 12r1, which is to say 12 with a remainder of 1 (fractions are unwelcome here, since the machine does not understand them)[1]. Therefore, we push the remainder 1 onto the array x from the left-hand side, such that the array `x' now looks like this:

x = | 1 |.

Since 25 / 2 = 12, we use 12 as our new `n' in the next iteration, leading us to . . .

STEP TWO.  We've replaced 25 with 12, but the rest of the calculation is the same. 12 / 2 = 6r0, and thus we push 0 onto the array `x' from the left side so that its appearance is now:

x = | 0 | 1 |.

STEP THREE.  n = 6, and 6/2 = 3r0, necessitating that 0 be pushed onto x, yielding

x = | 0 | 0 | 1 |.

STEP FOUR.  Our new n = 3, and 3/2 = 1r1. Thus 1 is pushed onto x.

x = | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |.

STEP FIVE.  n = 1, and 1/2 = 0r1, providing

x = | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |,

which is normally written as 11001, though for purposes of clarity we shall denote it 11001_2.

Note that this operation required five steps, since the binary representation of 25_10 is five digits long. Such translations from one base to another are rather tedious and time-consuming, and for that reason they are best done by machine (once one has acquired a firm grasp of the fundamentals, naturally).

** SECOND POSTURE: DYADS TO DECADS

Given the array x above, we can see that each cell can contain either a one or zero, and that those numbers correspond to `states' which we might call `on' or `off'. When a one is inserted into a given cell, the result is that we must calculate the value of the number contained by that cell; this is based upon its position in the array which denotes its exponent, which is in turn affected by its base of representation. For this example we are interested in dyads, or ``base-two" representations.

[FIGURE A.2]

| Cell `state'                |   1 |   1 |   0 |   1 |
| Exponent                    | 2^3 | 2^2 | 2^1 | 2^0 |
| Base-10 Value for each cell |   8 |   4 |   0 |   1 |
