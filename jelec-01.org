The first time Glynis McGinty found out that she could transform into a bird, and could speak the secret language of birds, was shortly after her twelfth birthday.

At her mother's insistence, in order to fill the long summers with no school, she had taken a very modest job at one of the local hotels. For four hours from eight to twelve noon, she would fold and stack sheets and towels in the hotel laundry, and also run small errands for the desk clerks as needed. She didn't mind doing this, as it got her out of the house a few mornings each week, and it gave her the freedom of a little spending money. For this she was the envy of her friend John and sister Marla, who were themselves twelve and ten, respectively, and who coveted her freedom from parents as much as the little money she earned.

This was especially true in the case of little Marla McGinty, since it is a well-known fact that little sisters like to be allowed to do the same things that big sisters do, which is generally harmless and perfectly alright, except of course when it isn't. And when you're the Big Sister that Little Sister is following, it never is.

This meant that despite Glynis' fervent pleas to her mother, Marla would accompany them on the drive to the hotel each morning at seven-thirty, come rain or shine.

And what a hotel it was! The Sycamore Hotel and Resort had stood by the shores of Lake William for over a century, and in all that time no other had been built that could rival it. Standing, as it did, on an island just off the western shore, it was a white jewel set in the blue heart of the lake, visible from the tops of nearby mountains for miles around.

It was to this small island that Glynis rode with her mother and her sister Marla two or three mornings each week, leaving the house for the drive over the mountains into the town, which was also called Lake William. It was the sort of town that people who lived in cities went to when they wanted to "get away from it all," a small place on the shore of a lake in the mountains. Glynis and her family loved it, and they enjoyed a quiet life there.

Until Glynis took a job at the Sycamore Hotel, that is.

It all began innocently enough, as adventures go. Glynis was in the laundry room surrounded by bins of white towels that needed folding, and so she was doing just that. It was a cool, clear morning in early June. The dew was on the grass, and Mr. Stephens, the hotel manager, was feeling ambitious again.

"Oh, Glynis!" A voice called from behind a particularly overstuffed laundry cart, rousing Glynis from her daydreams about sailing ships and white towel seas.

"Yes, Mr. Stephens. I'm back here with the towels."

"Ah, there you are." He emerged from behind a small mountain of pilowcases, clutching his ever-present black notebook, which he turned to as Glynis looked on. "Where was I? Oh yes, page forty-two: "Special Projects." Yes, well, since this is your first summer here at the Sycamore, you probably don't know about this, but every year I create one or two of what I like to call 'Special Projects,' that need to be done above and beyond the regular work we do. Things that otherwise slip through the cracks."

"Slip through the cracks?" Glynis had never heard this expression before, and she wondered what her mother would think of it. Mrs. McGinty was not the sort of person to allow slipperiness, cracking (wise-or-otherwise), or any combination thereof.

"Oh, you know, the sort of thing which needs doing but never seems to get done. Usually we're so busy with taking care of our guests that we don't have time for much else, so I schedule these things in as and when I can. Anyway, just go and see Brian at the front desk; he'll give you all the details." And with that, he turned on his heel and left as quickly as he'd arrived.

"What a strange man," Glynis thought as she continued folding her way through her ocean of white towels. "Just buzzing in one moment, and out the next! I suppose a hotel manager must have to have a lot of energy, especially at a big place like this. I wonder what sort of "special" this project will be? I guess I'll find out soon enough."

And so Glynis returned to her folding, and to her daydreams, until the formerly vast white towel ocean had become a mere pond, hardly big enough for a sailing ship anymore, though perfectly nice for paddling a canoe in with a friend. It was at around this time that Glynis noticed the clock on the laundry room wall, which told her that it was half past eleven. She knew that her mother would be coming for her soon, and so she climbed the three flights of stairs to the main floor of the hotel, where her friend Brian worked. She liked Brian; he was funny and always had a smile and a kind word to share, and he would often let her sit behind the front desk with him while she waited for her mother to arrive.

"Hey Brian!" she called, happy to see her friend. Since there were no guests at the desk, she didn't have to worry about formalities.

"Hey yourself, kiddo! What's the latest news from the laundry dungeon?" /Yes/, Glynis thought, /this is definitely a guest-free environment/.

"Not too much news. White towels on and off all day today, with tomorrow's forecast calling for a ninety-five percent chance of more white towels. But that's not all, Brian."

"Oh no?"

"No. Mr. Stephens came to see me this morning, and he said he had a 'Special Project' for me, and that I should come and see you about it. I guess it's something he puts together every year?"

"Oh Glynis, you are a lucky girl, aren't you?" he said with a grin. "Follow me then, you poor soul," he added, grabbing a flashlight from under the desk.

And so she did. They left the lobby and followed the hall to the North Wing of the hotel. When they had reached the very far end of the building and could go no further, Brian turned and, after some fumbling with the lock, went through a narrow door that opened onto a dark stairwell.

"This is an old part of the hotel," he explained, though it seemed clear enough to Glynis that it was. "We've gone through several renovations over the years, and you can probably guess that these stairs aren't legal under the building codes we have now. It's hard to believe that this used to be how people got around inside the hotel. Can you imagine chambermaids carrying laundry up and down these narrow stairwells, or bellhops carrying luggage?"

Glynis had to admit that she couldn't. She was too busy trying not to trip and fall while studying the strange patterns illuminated in the wallpaper by Brian's flashlight. It was a sort of paisley print, shot through with curlicues arranged in such a way that they kept catching in the corners of her eyes, and she found it very distracting. Added to that was the difficulty of navigating the stairs themselves, which were tall and narrow in the style of very old houses. Or very old hotels, for that matter.

Glynis had known that the hotel was old, but it was one thing to hear her mother say it and another actually to see this strange, dry wallpaper curling off the walls like onion skin, or to feel the thin boards creak and sag in the middle of each step as she and Brian walked over them. Down one, two, three cramped flights of stairs they went, and it seemed to her that they were almost holding their breath as they went, so strange was the place they'd found themselves in. It truly was as if they had gone back in time. She realized that they were now back to the lowest level of the hotel, where the laundry room was, and where she'd just spent all morning working.

How strange to think that she had just come from there! You wouldn't even know you were in the same building, especially given the smell of the place, which she was just beginning to notice. It was musty, and gave the impression of a place which hadn't been disturbed in a very long time indeed.

"Glynis, can you hold the light for me? I need to open the cellar door." Brian was fumbling with his keys again. "I need to get at the fuse-box and get these lights working again before any work can begin, but I just wanted to give you a quick tour."  And with that he bent down, fumbled a bit with a lock and latch, and lifted two large sections of the wood floor, first one and then the other. Together they opened on hinges like a pair of rusty wings, revealing a passage underground.

"This is the deepest part of the building, Glynis, and it's where you'll be working for the next several weeks, in addition to your regular duties in the laundry room. As I said, I still need to fiddle a bit with some fuses and bulbs to make things habitable, but once I've done that, you should be able to come and go as you please."

"That's all very nice, Brian, but what is it I'm supposed to be doing down here? You still haven't told me."

"Ah well, now comes the magic bit. Take this flashlight and go over to the edge of that opening there. Be careful not to fall in, because there aren't any stairs, so we'll need to get you a ladder. Now crouch down and shine your light into that big hole in the floor, and tell me what you see."

Glynis did as she was asked, but she decided to lie on her stomach instead to get a better look. And when her eyes followed the beam of her flashlight down into that dark place, what did they see?  They saw ornately carved dressers and liquor cabinets, faded paintings in gilded frames. There were rolled-up carpets and lamps with shades of many-colored glass. And more that her eyes could not detect, receding into the darkness, but no doubt covered in the same dirt and dust and faded grandeur as what she saw now. She felt like an explorer cracking open a Pharoah's tomb, and the old hotel was the pyramid which held it all.

She knew right then that she couldn't wait for another visit to see what was there; she had to start exploring it right away.

"Brian, you said there's no ladder yet, but I do so want to have a quick look around, now that we're all the way down here. Is there any way you can lower me down for a quick peek?"

"I don't know, Glynis. Your shift is almost up," he said, looking up from his watch.

"I'll be in and out before you know it. Please?" She put on her best approximation of an `aren't I a nice young girl not to mention completely trustworthy at all times' face. Brian was helpless against it, or very nearly so. "All right, all right --but it's a quarter 'til twelve already, so no dilly-dallying, O.K.?"

"O.K." She tried not to grin too broadly, lest he should change his mind. "Five minutes or less, on my honor as an employee of this fine hotel."

Brian had to smile and shake his head at that, and then he turned and began searching in the darkness for something to lower her with. After a moment's grunting and some jostling aside stacks of wooden deck chairs and dusty bookshelves, he emerged from behind an eight-foot dry sink with a tallish stepladder in hand. A bit more digging produced some white rope, a former clothesline probably, and they were ready.

"So here's the plan," he said as he began tying one end of the rope to the top of the ladder. "I'll lower the stepladder onto the floor with the rope and, if it holds, I'll lower you down onto it, and you can walk from there. I'll stay up here, and try to preserve my last clean shirt, that is unless you need me for anything. Either way, you've got five minutes and then we go, no questions asked? Got it?"

"Got it."

And so Brian did as he'd planned, lowering the stepladder into the cavern beneath them. When he'd finished, Glynis came over and, with his help, stepped down onto the ladder's top step. It was surprisingly stable, and she turned to Brian to gather their only flashlight before leaving him there in the darkness.

"Four minutes, forty seconds," said Brian, half-smiling, though Glynis couldn't see it.

"I'll be right back."

Glynis climbed down the stepladder with no surprises and found herself surrounded by all of the wonderful and strange things she'd only glimpsed a moment ago. She had sensed that there was more to the room than she had at first seen, and as she picked her way by the flashlight's beam through the maze of four-poster bed frames and antique rolltop writing desks, she found she'd been right. The Cavern (as she had already taken just now to calling it in her mind) seemed to extend the entire length of the North Wing of the hotel.

Glynis realized then that this was going to be a very big job indeed.

Just then her light caught the edge of something that flashed, something over by the wall. She had been walking down a sort of central aisle that had been left clear, so she turned left, in the direction of the flash, and began squirming between the bookcases and wardrobes, trying to find its source. Worried that she'd lost it, she began sweeping the flashlight from side to side, a bit wildly perhaps, when she saw the flash again. She was much closer now and was able to discern that there were mirrors and other various glass items leaning against the walls, some covered in burlap, and some not. She had homed in on her target's general location when the third flash came, several feet ahead. As she approached, she could see clearly that her quarry was entirely covered in burlap save one corner, and that it too was leaning against the Cavern wall.

Glynis did next what any curious person, young or old, would do, and when she had slid the burlap tarp onto the floor, her eyes widened at the treasure which lay before them.

There was a tree at its heart, a tree rendered in a window of stained glass, its many-colored leaves reminding Glynis of autumn, which was still months away. The branches of the tree, leafy and full, were supported by a massive, gnarled trunk that disappeared into a grassy hillside. Upon further inspection, she could see that it was a maple tree by the shape of its tiny glass leaves. Behind the tree, an expanse of clear blue sky faded up into the star-filled blackness of the heavens, as the sun and moon hovered far overhead, one in each corner of the starry heights. Each had been given a face: the moon's, dreamy and cool, was the face of a woman gently smiling, while the sun had the prominent brow and nose of a man, his expression resolute and strong. Between and below the sun and moon, directly above the tree in question, was a constellation of small, bright stars which Glynis had never seen before. She made a mental note to start looking for that constellation in her own sky or, failing that, some books on astronomy in the Lake William Public Library.

In her musings over the mysterious constellation, her eyes wandered over the entire window, not really settling on any feature in particular, until she noticed a small, uneven rectangle hidden in the gnarled lines of the tree's trunk. Though it was quite small, she could make out the Roman numerals inside: XIII. Thirteen. "What does that mean?" she wondered to herself. "Are there thirteen of these windows? By the same artist, or many?  Maybe there are more of them down here," she speculated aloud. Her curiosity piqued, she took an oath, or something she thought very much like it, in the sense that an oath is a promise to yourself; her oath went like this: "On my honor as Glynis Helen McGinty, I will discover the secrets of this window of stained glass, not least among them the name of the secret constellation and the mysteries of the many-colored tree, numbered thirteen. I hereby take, of my own free will, a solemn oath that I shall not cease in my labors until the secrets of this window are known. Let it be done."

At that point, surprised at her own strange behavior, and having sworn to the seriousness of her intent, Glynis reached out to touch the tree of glass, thereby sealing the oath-taking ceremony in her mind and in time. As her fingers approached it, the sky behind that strange tree began to ripple as if reflected in water. One inch more her curious fingers came closer, and the leaves of that odd tree swayed first this way, then that, as if caught in a mild evening breeze. Glynis was not afraid, however, having sworn such a solemn oath (not to mention being naturally curious, and perhaps not in her right mind of course), and so her child's fingers didn't hesitate for an instant. The unknown constellation responded in kind to her curiosity, twinkling and fading as if to the rhythms of a music she could hear, or perhaps the music was her own? She could no longer tell, entranced as she was by this magical scene: tree, sky, and stars each dancing after their own fashion to this music without time.

When at last her fingertips reached the tree, they felt not iron and stained glass, but moist leaf and branch. The gentle breeze she had thought imaginary a moment before now touched her bare arms. A turn of her head revealed the same secret constellation, now far overhead, still twinkling and dancing merrily in the night sky. Far above, shining down on all, was the moon; though faceless now, and cold, it glowed beautifully nonetheless.

"Where am I?" she wondered quietly. "What is this place?" She was surprised to find that she felt no fear, despite her strange journey (which had mostly involved standing in one place, but many journeys are like that, as any child can tell you).

"Wondering what to do next, are we?" The voice carried down out of the tree, raspy and sharp.

It startled Glynis. "Who's there? Come on, show yourself. Don't be afraid, I'm not going to hurt you."

"Strange to think that you could hurt me, child. I am older than any that walk your world. You'd do well to rein in your tongue a little here, I think. This --"

"-- And where is here, pray tell, O Kind Voice that Lives in a Tree? And who are you?"

Glynis knew it was rude to interrupt people (if this was indeed a person), but she'd listened to enough of her mother's lectures to know that sometimes it's best to stop long speeches before they get started.

The voice did not respond to her question. Afraid she had driven it away entirely, Glynis tried to apologize. "I'm sorry, kind voice. I didn't mean to offend you. I'm lost, that's all. I don't know where I am."

The branches above her head began to shake, a little at first, and then a lot. The shaking grew violent, and she began to fear for her poor head as small branches began falling from the tree to the grass all around her.

The voice returned, this time much deeper and louder. "That you don't know where you are, that much is clear. This realm does not forgive ignorance so easily, child. If you would travel these lands, you must learn to have a care for your speech, for words are powerful things here, in the Realm of the White Bear."

Just then the tree, which had been shaking wildly and dropping branches as the voice spoke, groaned and convulsed mightily, as if throwing off a great weight. Glynis jumped back, trying to avoid danger, if danger it was, and saw something large and dark emerge from the top of the tree. The dark shape climbed high above before it swooped down, wings outstretched, coming to rest in the grass a few feet away, in the tree's moonlit shadow.

Glynis was cowering away now, a little afraid. The shape removed itself from the tree's shadow and Glynis gasped: it was a giant, ragged bird, oilblack, with a twisted, ragged beak. The creature just stood there a moment, half-opening and then closing its wings, which were enormous, the biggest Glynis had ever seen, even on television. Overcoming her fear, Glynis asked, "Um, pardon me, Mr. Bird, sir, but I don't know where I am, and I've grown a little afraid. Yes, I'm afraid I'm well and truly lost."

"Finally, you begin to talk sense," the creature croaked, not entirely unpleasantly. "Now we can move on to the next stage of our encounter."

* HONEY DRAGON

"The first thing you must know about this realm," the raven began, "is that words have power here. They call things into being, and at other times can destroy, and one cannot always know which beforehand. One must speak carefully here, or not at all.

"A special case, and a particularly perilous one at that, is that of names. Knowing the name of a thing -- animal, mineral or vegetable -- will grant you powers over that thing; but in this you must be careful as well, for one cannot know in advance to what extent those powers will contain the will of the creature, tree or what-have-you.

"That is why it is especially important never to reveal your true name to anyone here, or any thing, even a tree or a stone that sits by a river. There are conjured in this place all manner of beings, some with minds of their own, and some without. You will often not know which until it is too late, so it is best to watch your tongue."

Hearing this, Glynis' first instinct was simply not to speak at all. But being lost leaves one little choice in the matter, if one desires to find one's way home. "This is a very strange place, Mr. Bird, sir. I hope you can teach me how to speak carefully here. I'm not used to such things, since where I come from I can say whatever I please, for the most part, without creating or destroying anything."

"On the contrary!" the giant creature screeched. "You are creating and destroying things all the time, merely in a careless fashion, for you have no Guides to show you the hidden ways. Oh, there are a few men and women of knowledge among you, but they are scattered across the lands, disregarded. Their councils, though wise, do not penetrate your Halls of Power."

"So what are you saying? That my world has this word-magic? I've never seen it, nor met anyone who did. It's mostly confined to stories for children."

"What I can tell you is this," he said. "All realms are simply leaves from the same branch, or branches from the same tree, if you prefer. There is indeed what you call magic in each of these realms, to greater or lesser extent. This depends upon the knowledge of the inhabitants of each realm, and how it is created or destroyed by the speech uttered therein."

"Speech has power." Her tone made it a question.

"No. Speech is power," the raven crackled. His voice was deep and reverent.

Glynis nodded slowly; she might not understand why yet, but she decided to play along for the moment -- or until she went home, whichever came first. Being thrown unwittingly into an alternate world where giant black birds come and speak to you has a way of building patience quickly, or at least a willingness to cooperate.

"In that case," Glynis was speaking as carefully as she could now, "I have two questions for you. First, you said earlier that this was, what did you call it? The Realm of the White Bear. What did you mean? Second, as names are so important, I shall need one to call you by, if we are to continue our pleasant relations." That last phrase was one Mrs. McGinty often used when she was encouraging Glynis and her sister Marla to get along.

The raven seemed pleased enough with the format of her questions, and so he drew himself to his full height, taking a deep breath, preparing as if to give a formal address. "Well said, Young Miss, or well enough for one just come to these lands. I shall answer your questions, though in reverse -- for in asking, the most important query is naturally given first; in answering, however, one must share that which is most valuable at the end, as in any good journey or tale thereof."

Glynis wasn't sure she understood all of what had just been said, so she decided to wait. Her wisdom, it seemed, was growing from moment to moment.

"However, much of the joy in a journey lies in the companions one meets along the way, and a good name, though not sufficient in the least, can carry one far, if well-chosen.

"In that spirit, I would like you to call me Meldrake, which is the Black Dragon, or the Honey Dragon in some tongues I know. My blackness is clear to any with eyes to see it; what sweetness I have at my command may become clearer as the journey lengthens. Which, of course, journeys have a way of doing, especially here in the Realm of the White Bear. And so we come now to my second answer to your first question. Here the path of our little encounter narrows a bit, and wends its way through a rather darker part of the forest, as it were."

The great raven Meldrake was exceedingly large, as we have seen, Dear Reader, and yet now he came down from his proud stance of a moment before. His voice lowered, became quiet and soft to Glynis' ears. He shuffled his feathery bulk nearer to Glynis and seemed to her to shrink just a little.

"Everything here has many names, and so you know now that to know the name of a thing is to glimpse its essential nature, provided that the name you have at your disposal is in fact the true one. Therefore, it is exceedingly important that you do not share your best name, your soul's true name, with anyone, and that includes me."

"You may be wondering what all of this has to do with a White Bear." Meldrake paused, allowing Glynis to nod along solemnly. "The White Bear is the most powerful force in these lands. Notice that I did not say he is the lord of these lands. He keeps no castles or great halls, nor does any court attend to him, as one might expect of a ruler. He is simply the mightiest creature known to any here, a force unto himself. He roams the deep forests of the realm, and all about him, wherever he treads, the land is covered in snow for miles."

"For reasons which are unknown to me, he has been known as the Protector since before anyone now living can remember, and though he is a fearsome beast indeed, a friend to none, the name has stuck. Long ago I learned that even those who would call themselves wise question the common names of things at their peril. For each name, however small, has an old beginning which we cannot see now, and the reasons behind it are secrets that the dead alone often keep."

"The Land of the White Bear, like any other name which we've discussed, is but one name for this place among many. There are others, imbued with power, which I will not utter to a newcomer such as yourself."

"The mysteries of this place will only give themselves up to you should you prove worthy of them by your deeds. Words alone, though powerful, are no substitute. In the interest of moving our own little adventure along, then, perhaps we should agree on a comfortable name for you?"

Glynis thought for a long moment. It was clear that words were important here, and she worried that she might not choose the right one. She started to get nervous, like she did when she was taking a test in school. Meldrake's bird's eye stare wasn't helping, either. Just then it came to her -- she'd just finished the seventh grade, and one of her favorite subjects was also the first elective she'd ever chosen: Latin. Back at home, she had several boxes of index cards, each one with a different Latin word on it. She'd spent hours writing them, and there was one word in particular that she'd always loved: "Avis." Bird.

"Avis," she said at last. "You can call me Avis." She wondered if anyone (or any thing) knew about Latin in this strange place.

* GLYNIS AND TREE

Sunlight came streaming in through the windows of Glynis' bedroom. Gradually the combination of heat and light on her face became too much to ignore, and Glynis was forced to open her eyes a crack. She didn't have to like it, though, and her eyes scanned round weakly for any sign of her alarm clock. It read a quarter past six. Glynis figured groggily that she could probably squeeze another thirty minutes of sleep in before her mother came calling for her.

The early morning summer sunshine had no such plans for her, however. It continued pouring its bright beauty into her bedroom with abandon, as if to say, "The new day is here! Go forth, and joyfully, too!"

After a few moments of such ungentle persuasion, Glynis was no more asleep than you and I are, Dear Reader, and so she simply lay in bed with the covers off, watching the morning light fill the trees outside her window. Behind those trees rose the mountains which surrounded the McGinty home, covered in their various shades of green.

Her quiet reverie wasn't to last for long, however.

"Glynis! Glynis! O Glynis!" A small, sharp voice was calling. Glynis groaned to herself; it seemed her peace and quiet would end, having hardly begun.

"Glynis! We're having breakfast and Mom wants you to come down here!" The voice was growing more insistent, and to Glynis' horror it seemed to be getting closer. It wasn't thirty seconds later that her bedroom door was flung open without so much as a by-your-leave, and there stood her tormentor in the flesh.

"Come /on/! Mom's got french toast, and we can't let it sit and get cold just because you won't get out of bed!"

"Marla, it's twenty after six in the morning. What in Heaven's name are you doing, stomping around and hollering like a fool? It's just rude."

Marla, being ten years old and whip-smart, was entirely immune to her older sister's mock perturbation. Eyes wide, her hands stuck on her hips, she strolled theatrically to Glynis' bedside.

"I'll tell you what's rude: lying in bed while there's a delicious breakfast waiting on the table, and then Mom has to send me up here just to wake you up. Meanwhile, the rest of us have to sit and wait!"

Glynis knew that her mother had done no such thing, but she groaned and rolled out of bed just the same. She couldn't help  thinking that her sister Marla was being entirely too theatrical about a few lousy pieces of french toast, but she supposed that theatre was the price you paid for having a little sister.

Naturally, Marla beamed broadly as Glynis shuffled ever-so-reluctantly to the stairs, and then down them, ever so slowly, into the bright kitchen. For the moment, Glynis had staved off Marla's manufactured exuberance with her own reserves of exaggerated grogginess.

Even so, the kitchen /was/ exceedingly bright. Mrs. McGinty had thrown open the curtains to the East, which allowed the day's new light to flood in, with an especial emphasis on the breakfast table. It was there that the culinary treasures Marla had promised lay in wait for the hungry children, steam rising.

"Good morning, girls," said Mrs. McGinty pleasantly. She was, as usual, turned out nicely in slacks and an oxford shirt, despite the early hour.

Glynis slid into an empty chair at table. "Morning."

"Hey, Mom. Guess who I found?" Marla liked feeling that she was exerting some influence over her big sister's behavior.

Glynis, for her part, didn't mind letting Marla feel like she had that influence. It didn't cost her much to do it, after all.

And so the girls set eagerly upon their short stacks of french toast, letting the sun warm their bodies as the smell of their mother's coffee machine filled the air.

"Can I have some coffee, Mom?" Glynis asked.

It was something her mother allowed her from time to time.

"I don't know, dear. I don't want coffee to become a habit just yet; you're only twelve, after all. Maybe another time."

Glynis shrugged. "O.K."

"Oh, before I forget, there's something I need you to do for me today. I need you to pop over to Neville's jewelry store after work and pick up that brooch of your grandmother's, you know, the one she wore to church? I just had it cleaned, and they called yesterday and said it's ready to pick up."

"Does that mean you're going to be late picking me up?"

"I'm afraid so. Marla and I have a dentist's appointment at eleven. You'll be all right waiting for a bit, won't you?"

"Don't worry about me, Mom. I've got plenty to do."

The rusty Jeep Cherokee pitched and rolled from side to side as the leaden foot of Mrs. Jane McGinty encouraged it to ever-higher speeds along the twisting mountain roads. Such was her familiarity with the route that she rarely applied the brakes on their frequent jaunts over the mountain into Lake William. The girls enjoyed the ride immensely; it seemed that they had inherited their mother's "need for speed," as she was fond of calling it.

Clinging to the backseat as her mother pitched it into yet another bend in the road at speed, Glynis wondered if anyone in Lake William had any idea that this petite, neatly turned-out woman with her blonde ponytail and khaki slacks was such a lead-footed hell-driver.

Somehow she doubted it.


---

Glynis spent the morning at the hotel folding towels and, naturally, her mind returned to the events of the day before, and her strange visit to the Land of the White Bear. It had been quite a shock, as you might imagine, and her mind was still adapting to the knowledge that there was, um, how to put it? At least one other realm of existence (and probably more), alternative to her own, in which giant, talking ravens were roaming free /at this very moment/, doing whatever it is that giant, talking ravens do when they aren't giving introductions to the broader points of naming conventions in magical realms to lost young girls?

Yes, it had taken Glynis some time and effort to reconcile that in her mind. No, it hadn't kept her from wanting to go back, though this was less a result of bravery than of intense curiosity, the kind that famously killed the cat.

It was that curiosity which brought her back to the desk and to her friend Brian Smalls. Once again, the clock on the laundry room wall told her it was around a quarter 'til twelve, and she made her way up the three flights of stairs to the foyer of the Sycamore Hotel.

The season had begun, and business had picked up a good deal over the last few days. This meant that the front desk was now a busy place. Guests and potential guests were waiting to check in, check out, complain about the televisions in their rooms, and all of those other various and wonderful things which people do when they leave their hometowns to become tourists.

Brian, for his part, was pleasant, accommodating, and efficient as ever. "I'm sorry for the inconvenience, Mr. Janesky," he said to one balding, older man. "I've dispatched our head of maintenance, George Murphy, to your room to look at that refrigerator. In the meantime, I can offer you another room if you like--"

"There's no need for that, Brian," said Mr. Janesky. "We're very happy with our view of the lake."

"Well, I have an idea. We have a certain number of tickets for free parasailing with several companies here in Lake William that do such things. Have you ever been parasailing, Mr. Janesky?"

"No, I haven't. Is that where they strap you to a parachute, and they tow you? I've seen it. I know my grandson would like it. He's coming up with my daughter tomorrow from the city."

"Then please, take these tickets. They're cluttering up my desk anyway," Brian joked.

Mr. Janesky smiled as he took two parasailing tickets from Brian. "My grandson will like this. Thank you, Brian." He stepped aside for the next customer in the queue.

Glynis saw her chance to slip behind the desk and borrow the keys that would get her back to the basement. She gave Brian a quick nod and pointed at the keys to signal her intentions, to which he replied: "Enjoy!" before turning back to the next customer in line.

Keys and flashlight in hand, she made her way back to the North Wing, pausing for a moment at the door to the stairwell to take in the view of Lake William offered by the nearby window. It was yet another "bluebird" day, the rich green mountains falling right down to the water's crystal blue edge. Cloudless skies flew overhead. Meanwhile, all manner of sailboats, motorboats, and other craft were making their way to the various islands and hidden bays which Lake William had to offer her visitors.

Glynis drank in the idyllic view for a moment more, then was back to business. She switched on the flashlight as she stepped into the old stairwell and made her way swiftly and silently down the steep and narrow stairwell, her heartbeat quickening at the thought of returning to the strange realm of her recent dream. For a dream it must have been, she thought, however vivid, however fresh in her mind. It was difficult to deny the contents of one's own memory, she had to admit as she reached for the lock on the butterfly-shaped cavern doors . . .


---

She was only too glad to have her mind's version of events confirmed by the sight of the great, dark tree which stood before her. A sea of mist surrounded Glynis and the tree on all sides, and seemed to rise up from below the high hill on which she and the tree were perched.

/<Has something changed?>/

/<Differences, beautiful differences!>/ 

/<This is not like before.>/

Glynis wondered where the voices were coming from but it was night once again where the great tree stood, and between the dark and the mist her eyes did her searching little good.

/<Am I lost?>/

/<Should I be here, now?>/

Glynis thought these questions wordlessly and without bidding, which surprised her a little.

/<The mind is weak.>/

/<O where am I to go?>/

With the last, Glynis became frightened. Somehow she was thinking thoughts that were not her own. Or perhaps she'd gone well and truly mad, as she'd feared since her first 'visit' the day before. Was she here, or was she sitting in the hotel basement, overtaken by a broken mind?

Either way, she had to do something. Inaction would only make matters worse -- she'd learned that much from her mother. She cupped her hands to her mouth to call out, and to her surprise, this is what came out:

"Hail, fellow creatures of the world! I am Avis, the Ocean Bird, the Portent of Things to Come! Any here within the sound of my voice, touched by that sound, are touched by my mind as well. Come forth, and Speak!"

What happened next was even more surprising.

One by one, amid snarls and squawks and the flapping of great, dark wings, large shapes began to descend from the skies above the tree. Seven in all there were, great birds of Meldrake's like, though not all were ravens such as he. Certainly several of them had an ill-favored look, that seemed to Glynis to convey malice of some secret kind -- or perhaps not-so-secret -- she'd find out soon enough.

As they came down unquietly from the starry heights, they surrounded the tree on all sides, and Glynis with it. After a moment or two more of squawk and screech, and arraying themselves as they pleased, one came forward to speak.

/<Greetings, child.>/ Its voice had a burbling quality, as if coming from somewhere underwater, but coated with a sharpness of crushed shells from the deep ocean.

The one that had stepped forward was a fat, grey thing. Its greasy, unkempt feathers clung together in matted clumps. A strip of red cloth was wrapped over one eye, leaving a single silver orb rimmed in red with which to see the world.

/<What brings you to these lands? I must say, that's a powerful call for such a tiny creature as you. Who taught you how to do that?>/

Glynis wasn't sure what to do, and so she thought it best to remain silent while she gathered her wits. "Boy, you've really stepped in it this time, haven't you?" she thought to herself.

The nasty gray thing's head twitched up, down, and around with unnatural quickness, and let out a screech. It leaned over and peered at its feet.

/<What have I stepped in, child? I see nothing but grass here.>/

Glynis' eyes went wide. She hadn't said a word!

The creature's lone eye flashed a look round at its companions. Each took a step inward, closing into a tighter circle around Glynis, who had been standing a few feet from the tree. She decided that now was a good time to take a few steps back. As she did so, she noticed the small "XIII" carved into the trunk, about three feet from the ground. She remembered seeing the same numeral in the stained-glass door which had brought her here in the first place, and that comforted her, though she couldn't explain why. It was better than nothing, though, so she marched over to it and without any further ado sat herself down cross-legged, with her back to the tree and the "XIII" overhead.

Some cawing and rustling of feathers followed. A few pairs of wings were opened and closed. The one-eyed bird turned and shambled heavily around the tree a few feet to where Glynis sat, trying to keep her mind empty of thoughts and her hands from shaking. It seemed that this creature had been able to hear her thoughts somehow, and she was determined not to reveal anything else unless and until she decided to do so.

/<You're not the first child to come stumbling through a crack in the world; there have been others.>/

Glynis noticed for the first time that the creature's beak wasn't moving as it 'spoke.' Her eyes were still wide, and her hands still shook with fear, but just then a thought came to her unbidden that if she would only stay with the tree, she would be alright.

/<Would you like to meet some of them? Come with us and we'll show you.>/

Glynis shook her head. "You're trying to lure me away from the tree," she said, her voice sounding small.

This brought a shriek from the ugly gray thing, who threw open his wings and, shooting his head forward like a snake with a quickness that surprised Glynis, snapped his beak open and shut a few inches from her face, as if he meant to tear it off if he could only reach her. He shrieked again, wings spread wide, and leapt into the air with an unlikely grace. One by one his silent companions followed, leaving poor Glynis alone, afraid, with her ears hurting a bit, perhaps, but otherwise unharmed.

---

Glynis sat for a long time under that tree, thinking about what had just happened, or nearly happened, and watching the stars turn slowly overhead. Though the constellations here were different, they turned in the same slow circles across the sky as those of her mountain home. This gave her comfort, as did the sturdy trunk and broad, leafy branches of the maple tree under which she sat. "Dream or no, I'm glad to see a maple tree here," she thought. Maple trees were her favorite sort of tree, especially because they gave their sap to make the delicious maple syrup that she loved.

Something told her that they didn't make much maple syrup around here, however.

Glynis was still there, sitting under the tree and wondering, wondering, when Meldrake arrived. She heard the same beating of dark wings in the air as before, sensed the same shape moving through the air above her, but something, perhaps the tree against which she sat, reassured her that this time there was nothing to fear. She began to think that she and the tree would become great friends. And so Glynis sat, awaiting her next visitor, and was not afraid.

It was Meldrake, of course, the great raven himself. Upon landing, he saw Glynis sitting beneath the tree. He stood still for a moment observing, and then walked around Glynis and tree three times in a counterclockwise direction before he spoke.

"Greetings, young Avis, and welcome back. I was told of your return, and of other things, some less pleasant to think on. Though I see that you have made a discovery; perhaps you'd like to tell me about it?"

And so Glynis did just that, starting with her most recent arrival in the Realm, her subsequent unexpected call into the night sky, and ending with her realization of the tree's power to protect her, and her newfound kinship with it.

Meldrake nodded at hearing of this.

"You have found your place of refuge in this world, and a great good thing it is, too. For even now it is clear to me that you know not what it is that you called down from the heavens."

"The creature you spoke to is known as "Redcloth" here. He is an abductor and a practitioner of blackest magic, specifically those parts of magic having to do with the mind. The minds of most others are as books to him: he can read their pages and, often enough, write his own words there as well. You noticed his telepathic abilities, I think.

"As for the others, they are but shells, figments of the mind of Redcloth, which he projects into our shared reality. They are his only friends, and dangerous each in his own right -- though they are but thought-stuff, created in one mind, they are not to be trifled with. Remember: 'Word, Thought, and Deed, all create or destroy at need.' In other words: they are as real as they need to be, and they can hurt you.

"As for the matter of this tree, you have discovered your 'Terminus Mundi,' your 'end of the world,' the place where the world's magic is strongest for you, where you will go for peace and strength. Sensing this, it is no wonder to me that the creature could not capture you here. Make no mistake, Avis: he will try again."

"I don't understand, Meldrake. Who is he, and what could he want with me?"

"Why, Avis, you just don't understand yet; that much is clear. You still carelessly toss off words and actions as if they're of no importance--"

"That's not entirely true, Meldrake. If anything, I was very careful. I could have said more to the creature and did not, once I thought better of it. Give me that much credit, at least."

"Credit? You still don't understand, do you? 'Avis, Ocean Bird, Portent of Things to Come' -- do you think you can throw words like that into the night sky, and that nothing will respond?"

"The fact is, you called these scavengers down. It wasn't by chance, either: some part of you, the part of you that knows more than you, wanted that meeting to happen, for its own reasons. As a result, you have found your Terminus, but you are known and marked by some very bad things now, and life will become more interesting, by which I mean difficult."

Meldrake had paused for a moment, so Glynis asked, "What should I do, Meldrake? You're starting to scare me a little with all this talk of being marked."

Meldrake shook his great, black head. "Listen, I am not here to tell you what to do. I have no way of knowing your Fate; that will be up to you. If you carry any of my words with you, let it be these: There are no accidents! Nothing occurs by chance, and even mistakes serve a purpose, though it is not always given to us to know what that purpose is."

Satisfied, the great raven folded his wings and sat back on his haunches. Glynis, meanwhile, had grown tired of just sitting, and so she stood and stretched her arms to the night sky. She looked up at the stars, and noticed that Meldrake was doing the same.

"So Meldrake," she asked quietly, "when do we go exploring? I'd like to see more of this place. Not that I'm complaining, mind you," she added.

"Soon enough," said the gentle Meldrake. "Though after today's close encounter, perhaps it's best we wait a bit. Better to let the danger subside, I think, than to go charging off into the wilds, unthinking and unprepared. You have done well, have no doubt of it, but I am concerned lest the strangeness of this place overwhelm you.

"Therefore, you must return home at once, without uttering another word. Wait three of your days, and then return here with someone whose friendship you can trust. In addition, bring these three items: a book whose wisdom you live by, a song that you sing in the dark, and a token of your family line.

"Finally, when you return, it must be at sunrise, which occurs in reverse here, such that your dusk is our dawn and vice versa. Your visits so far have come in the middle of night, when all manner of unseemly things are about, predator and prey. No time to go roving about, surely. Come here of a bright morning, however, and you will find a different forest standing here, and an altogether friendlier mood, I hope -- though my earlier warnings still apply, of course!"

Meldrake rose and spread his black wings against the chill night air. "Until then, Avis -- fare well! I shall look for you at dawn, three days hence," he cried as he rose into the starry sky above.

Glynis, for her part, left without saying a word.

* WEDDING CAKE BOATS

Glynis was just outside the door of the hotel, on her way into the village, when she heard someone calling her name. With a small sigh, she turned and went back inside.

It was the hotel manager, Mr. Stephens. "Glynis, I'm glad I caught you. I just wanted to know how things are going on the storage basement cleanup."

Glynis had to admit that she hadn't gotten very far yet. An hour here, an hour there, at the end of her shift -- yes, there is still plenty to be done, Mr. Stephens, and no, I haven't yet begun packing the antique lamps, though I will soon, of course.

"Actually, Mr. Stephens, I could use a hand down there. It's a big job, you know," Glynis said, in what she hoped sounded less like a complaint than a statement of fact.

"Certainly, certainly. Is there anyone you have in mind? Perhaps you've a friend who could use a little part-time job?"  Mr. Stephens smiled.

Glynis smiled back. Even old Mr. "Efficiency" Stephens showed a sense of humor once in a while, and she was only too glad to use this good fortune to help a friend.

"Actually, my good friend John Sharp is free for the summer, and could be a great help to me. I'll have to speak with him, but I'm quite sure he'll be interested."

"Excellent. Have him come by and see me. In the meantime, try to enjoy the rest of this glorious day."

"Thanks. You do that too, Mr. Stephens."

With that, Mr. Stephens smiled and turned away in his usual brisk manner, leaving Glynis to make her way once again into the blue brilliance of a Lake William June. It was just past noon, giving her plenty of time to walk the half-mile or so through the Village to Scoville's Jewelers and collect her grandmother's brooch before meeting her mother, and so she decided to take the boardwalk that ran along the edge of the lake and look at the boats.

Some years ago, before she was born, some enterprising person had decided to bring several of the old-time steam-powered riverboats to the deep waters of Lake William, and the Lake William Steamboat Co. was born. Glynis had loved the boats ever since she was a small child, for their beauty and the piercing blast of their foghorns, and for the fact that no two of them were built just alike. "Wedding cake boats," she had called them as a little girl, and the name still fit. Each boat consisted of several "layers," --decks actually--, all but one of which were open to the air, and was driven by a great, wooden paddle wheel. At the height of the summer season they would run all day and into the night, offering guided tours of the southern end of Lake William, with its many green mountain views, hidden bays, and wooded islands large and small.

Glynis herself had gone with her mother to a nighttime wedding reception aboard one of the boats, the venerable and locally-famous Minne-ha-ha. She had been enchanted by the experience: the blackness of the lake at night, the silence broken only by the sound of the great wheel and engine pushing her forward, the way the lights from houses along the shore twinkled and shone, reflecting across the night waters in shimmering white lines. She resolved to talk to her mother about letting her take another night cruise as soon as possible, preferably without her younger sister.

Still caught up in her daydreaming, Glynis continued up the garden path (or along the boardwalk, as it were) into town. As she strolled along the wooden planks, she watched as motorboats of various stripes pulled into the private docks of the many restaurants along the shore. Attendants in polo shirts, the colors of which varied by establishment, would emerge from nowhere to tie up the boats and help the inhabitants ashore, in some cases washing and refueling the craft as their owners dined on surf and turf mere feet away.

Continuing on into the downtown business district proper, or the "main drag," as Mrs. McGinty often referred to it, Glynis left the boardwalk and its lake views behind for storefronts and sidewalks lined with trees. She passed the "Olde Tyme Photo Shoppe," where she, Marla, and their mother had wriggled into corsets and rough stockings, topping it all off with a selection of feathery hats that had made them laugh and laugh. At the last minute Marla, ever the contrarian, had decided to dress as a boy instead, tucking her auburn hair into a bun beneath a boy-sized Stetson and wielding a pair of knockoff Colt revolvers (with the firing pins removed, of course). Mrs. McGinty had noted what a shame it was that Marla was hiding the light of her beautiful auburn hair "under a bushel," as it were, but that only made tomboy Marla scowl more tomboyishly than usual for the photo. Glynis had to admit that the effect had been, if not very ladylike, charming in a funny way, so much so that her mother had framed the resulting photograph and hung it in a place of distinction in the McGinty lavatory.

Moving along, Glynis passed the Lake William Wax Museum, where a rather animated Frankenstein patrolled the sidewalk and urged passers-by to come inside and be scared out of their wits. Glynis wondered how the man inside could stand to be trapped inside a costume on such a warm summer's day, but he seemed to be enjoying himself despite the heat.

After passing by a few more "touristy" attractions, shops and restaurants mostly, Glynis came to the Lake William Library. Though not technically her destination for the day's errand, the library was, and would likely remain, one of her favorite places in the entire world, and especially in Lake William. An older red brick building with white shutters, it was nestled well away from the street in what had always seemed to Glynis to be a small village park all its own, though no one had ever designated it as such. Shaded from the bright sun by a perimeter of giant oaks and maples, with an occasional evergreen added "to taste," as it were, the library was a refuge and sanctuary for all those who loved books and comfortable chairs in which to read them. Glynis had spent a great deal of time there as a child, and still did, often leaving with a bag or two of borrowed books at the end of each visit. And no visit to the library would be complete without sitting down for a chat with the kindly Mrs. St. Claire, the town librarian and a great friend to the McGinty family. Glynis resolved that she would have to visit again soon as she passed the library grounds and turned onto Glen Street, where Scoville's Jewelers occupied the first floor of an old wooden house at Number Thirty-Eight.

Old Mr. Scoville had passed away some time ago, but his son Patrick, who in his middle forties was still known as "young Mr. Scoville," was in attendance as usual behind the long, glass cases which held the various rings, necklaces, watches and so on which the modern customer expects from his or her local jewelry store. He was showing several necklaces of silver and gold to a young couple Glynis had never seen before, and whose accents marked them as out-of-towners, when Glynis walked in. Mr. Scoville paused his exhortations to the couple just long enough to look up and nod a quick "Hello, Glynis," before returning to his monologue on the virtues of one piece of jewelry over another, various precious metals and their properties and qualities, and the like. It sounded like it was going to take a while, so Glynis had a seat in one of several chairs along the wall and settled in for a wait. Unfortunately, the only magazines available on the small end table where she sat were about jewels, gold, and the other paraphernelia of the trade. Things were looking (and feeling) pretty hopeless for Glynis when at last Mr. Scoville's daughter Amanda emerged from the back room of the store. "Mandy," as she was known, was a teenager several years older than Glynis. Upon seeing the situation there in the store, she said to Glynis conspiratorially: "That's Dad for you, always trying to make the next sale. What can I do for you, Glynis? Are you here for the brooch your mother dropped off?"

Glynis smiled and nodded, so Mandy, with a quick "I'll be right back," disappeared into the back room again. She reappeared a moment later with a velvet-covered box in hand, and she set it on the counter facing Glynis. "Would you like to see it?"  she asked, and Glynis nodded expectantly. Few and far between were the occasions upon which Mrs. McGinty would allow the girls to look at, much less touch, their grandmother's ruby brooch.

As Mandy lifted the cover of the maroon velvet box, light from the window caught inside the precious thing, so that by the time she'd lifted the cover fully open, Glynis could scarcely look at the brooch straight on. It seemed to her that it was positively filled with light, and it reminded her at once of her grandmother Sorenson, who had been filled with what Glynis thought of as a strange and wonderful light of her own, one that had not been forgotten by Glynis and her mother and sister. Many families, to be sure, cherish the life and memory of a special grandmother, who brings grace, wit and that quantity of experience which can, to the unschooled eye, make forethought appear to be foreknowledge. The McGintys were happy to participate in that tradition, for Glynis' Grandmother Sorenson was such a one. Glynis always enjoyed hearing her stories about growing up in Denmark, and what it had been like to come over as a young girl with her father in search of a place to "grow some cows," as he liked to say. The saying had stuck in the family ever since, as had a number of others that Grandmother Sorenson had picked up along the path. These included gems such as "You've got more excuses than a cranberry merchant," "That boy is lazier than a cut dog," and Glynis' personal favorite, "It's hotter than the blue hubs of Hades." These and other sayings were the fruits of a life lived among the dairy farmers and "hillfolk" who filled the mountains and valleys surrounding Lake William.

Glynis was lost in these and other ruminations when a bell rang. The front door of the jewelry store opened, and in walked Mrs. McGinty and Marla. Marla saw the sparkling brooch from the front of the store and came over at once, a moth to a candle. Mrs. McGinty wasn't far behind, and was well met by young Mr. Scoville, who had by now apparently finished giving his "Short Course in Precious Stones" to yet another young couple just starting out. He seemed pleased to think that he had saved them from ignorance and ruin, at least as he saw it.

"Hello, Jane. Glynis, Marla." He nodded at each of them in turn. Mandy, for her part, could see that her help was no longer needed, and returned to whatever delights awaited her in the back room.

"Hello, Patrick. I take it the cleaning went well?" said Mrs. M., who was never much given to small talk.

"Oh yes. Absolutely. This brooch is shining like the day it was made. Brighter, in fact."

---

The next day Glynis didn't have work, and so, after spending the morning doing some chores around the house for her mother, she decided to go and visit her friend John Sharp. John and his family lived several winding miles down the road, a short car ride or a longish walk away, in a white cottage with a red tin roof. Like the McGinty farmhouse, the Sharp cottage was tucked well off the road into the great pine woods, though John's cottage was decidedly more rustic, a dwelling of the North Country if ever there was one. Firewood was stacked on the porch and in the small attached woodshed, and it seemed to Glynis that there was always a kettle on the stove or a plate of cookies fresh from the oven. Such was the hospitality of the Sharp family.

It wasn't long after she had arrived that Glynis suggested that she and John take a nice long walk in the woods. They had pressing business to discuss, and she preferred to be as far away from prying ears and eyes as possible. Luckily, John was an only child, and his mother was used to him disappearing into the nearby forests for good stretches, often whole afternoons.

Finally, Glynis felt safe in revealing her secret.

At first, John laughed, though not cruelly. He seemed to have a hard time believing poor Glynis. who, it was true, could be prone to a flight of fancy from time to time. Glynis had expected as much, however, and simply continued with her story as best she could. By the time she got to the bit about her encounter with Redcloth and her discovery of the maple tree that served, in that strange other place, as her "Terminus Mundi," John had become rather silent, and seemed to be listening intently as he walked. It wasn't until some moments later, after she had finished relating her last conversation with Meldrake, and the preparations he had bid her to make, that John finally spoke.

"Well, I guess you'd better have a friend with you then," he said simply, and that was that. He agreed to visit the Land of Jelec with Glynis the day after next, and to come by the hotel in order to speak with Mr. Stephens about a job helping Glynis.

With those items of business tabled for the moment, John and Glynis were free to enjoy the rest of their hike to Clear Pond, which lay atop a small mountain about two miles from John's cottage. Clear Pond had lived up to its name for as long as anyone could remember --it was said that you could look clear to the bottom, but that was only true for the first six feet from shore--. In fact, Glynis and John often called it "Clear Sky Pond" between themselves, as it so often reflected only those colors which the sky gave it. The pond was a place where they could go to be silent and consider, well, whatever one considers when at the shore of a pond in the mountains, away from the rest of the world. In this case, their pending journey into unknown and likely dangerous lands occupied their thoughts, and indeed one could hardly find a better spot on earth from which to consider such a journey. Or so they thought as they sat there at the water's edge.

It was John who finally broke the silence, pausing long enough from his stone-skipping and rock-hopping to gibe, "So, what're you, like a magician or something now?" This he did with a mischievous grin that made Glynis crack a smile of her own.

"I don't know yet," she answered truthfully.

* THE LANGUAGE OF BIRDS

Finally, the appointed day for Glynis' return to the Land of the White Bear had arrived. She still knew nothing of that mysterious creature other than what the raven Meldrake had told her. Her experiences thus far in the lands ruled by Jelec had been few, but auspicious in their way; small proof but proof nonetheless that she could go forth and hold her own in that magical realm.

She had made all of the necessary arrangements, put all the game pieces in place on the board. She had convinced both Mr. Stephens and her mother of her plan to work for several hours in the evening at the Sycamore, the better to coincide with the timing of the dawn as described by Meldrake, and she had gathered, along with her steadfast friend John Sharp, the three items of personal significance recommended by the giant raven, namely: "A book whose wisdom she lived by," "A song for a dark time," and finally "A token of her family line." This last had been especially difficult for Glynis to acquire, even if only for a short time, as it was in fact the very same ruby brooch which had belonged to her Grandmother Sorenson, and as such was prized by Mrs. McGinty above all things, save Marla and Glynis herself, of course. Glynis hoped that its temporary absence, of no more than a few hours or so, would pass unnoticed. Even so, she knew that she must protect it at all costs.

And so it was that Glynis, filled with a newfound determination and perhaps even a thimbleful of courage, arrived, after descending that same narrow stair and passing through that same cavernous winged cellar door, at the stained-glass window which had served as her portal to strange lands twice before, with John bravely in tow. John Sharp, for his part, had had little to say as he accompanied Glynis down through that elder part of the ancient Sycamore Hotel. His had always been a quiet way, and he was more given to observation than idle talk. This was doubly true given the unknown territories which were about to unfold before him, if Glynis was true to her word.

And of course she was. It wasn't long after 5:30 in the evening, according to Glynis' watch, when she laid her hand upon the tree set in stained glass, the one which had transported her twice before. It did so again, and to his eternal credit, John followed along directly after her.

Thus it was that the two good friends (and now fellow adventurers) found themselves sheltering beneath the leafy bulk of a giant maple tree. The tree itself was set atop a high, grassy hill, which it shared on this particular morning with a giant, shaggy bird --a raven to be precise. It was in fact wise Meldrake himself, Glynis' companion of her last two visits to the White Bear's Realm. His eyes closed, he stood facing the east, and with it the rising sun which was just now beginning to light up the snow-capped mountains limning the Northern horizon.

Glynis opened her mouth to speak, then thought better of it, preferring not to disturb Meldrake. Then she noticed the sound he was making, a sort of deep hum that seemed to resonate with the very earth beneath her feet. She turned to her friend John to check his reaction to the odd scene. He smiled back at her and went on watching, watching, silently, as was his wont, and Glynis was more grateful than ever for his quietly inquisitive nature.

"Greetings, Avis and friend," the great bird said after a moment, eyes still closed. "And welcome back. I trust that your journey was pleasant?" His eyes opened. Meldrake unfurled his wings and spread them, as if stretching after a long sleep.

"It was, Meldrake," said Glynis. Turning towards John, she said, "I'd like to present to you my very good friend. Unfortunately, he doesn't have a name yet." She had filled John in on the issue of names and other things as well as she could, which was well enough for the time being. No doubt they would both learn a great deal more as their travels wore on.

"That is as it should be," replied Meldrake. "Now to business: I trust as well that you've secured the items we discussed?"

Glynis replied that she had.

"Excellent! In that case we shall begin at the end -- your end, Avis, your 'Terminus Mundi'." Turning quickly to John, he said, "Young man, I trust that our Avis has informed you that, in this realm at least, each living creature has access to a place of strength and calm, her 'end of the world,' as it's here called --?"

John nodded.

"And I trust additionally that she has informed you that you must choose your own name here, and that you must needs *never* reveal your true name, as it would grant powers over you to any who uttered it?"

John nodded again.

"Good," Meldrake said approvingly. "Formalities, you understand. On to current affairs: I intend to begin with a brief tour, but in order to do so we'll need a better vantage point. Can you climb trees, young sir?"

"Of course," replied John Sharp, who was in fact known for his tree-climbing prowess back home.

"Very well. Please climb this tree at once, as there are things we simply cannot see from here, high hill or no."

At that, John began shimmying up the maple's trunk, and Glynis made as if to follow him, but was stopped by Meldrake. "One moment, my good Avis. I have other plans for you."

And so it was that John found himself climbing up through the black branches of the maple "all by his lonesome," as the saying goes. With each new branch that he climbed, it seemed that a new and greater view of meadow, hill and mountain opened before him as the ground fell further and further away.

Meanwhile, back on that ground, Glynis was watching as her friend disappeared among the broad leaves. Hands on her hips, she turned to Meldrake as if to say, "Well then?" He was standing at his full height, which Glynis guessed was about six and a half or seven feet; certainly, he was taller than anyone else she knew. His wings he brought up and out, as if modelling a pose for Glynis, which in fact he was. Glynis followed his lead, raising her arms up from her sides.

"First rule of flight --yes, yes, get your hands up, do as I do, that's it-- the first lesson of flight is commitment. There are no half-measures in mid-air; every slight movement of the body has profound effects, and therefore we must learn to control our bodies for maximum effect with minimal effort."

"Meldrake, I can't fly," Glynis said, and let her arms fall.

Meldrake shook his head.

"Be quiet, and listen. Your self-doubt is less than useless here. Now lift your arms from your sides, as I have done. Excellent!  You're finally listening a little," he mocked ruefully.

"Now for the easy part. Close your eyes, keeping your arms and hands open to the sky. Tilt your head back. Feel the rising sun warm your face. Focus on your breathing, make it nice and slow, and most of all deep. Big, deep breaths. Continue."

Glynis did just that, breathing in and out ever so slowly, focussing especially on letting her belly rise and fall with each intake and exhalation. She felt the morning sun on her skin as all traces of tension left her body, and with it her mind. She began wiggling her fingers, enjoying the sensations of movement and allowing her wrists and arms to get in on the act, and before she knew just exactly what she was doing she was flicking her hands open and closed, towards and away, as Meldrake looked on.

"There! That's it! Now you have it!" Meldrake cried.

Glynis closed her eyes and imagined her arms growing long and graceful, while continuing to experience the sensations working in her wrists, hands, and fingers. Meanwhile, her relaxed mind indulged itself in visions of rich meadows and forests, squares in a patchwork as seen from high above. It was a quilted world, a clean, tidy and peaceful place, free from everyday cares.

Something in her felt a great need for such a place, and rose up to meet it, to meet the dream in her mind's eye. It was a longing such as she had never known.

Her dreaming mind sought out the horizon, and with it the swift sunrise. In that place, high over even the dark mountains, she turned to see still more of the new country unfolding below her, all the lands of the White Bear, the Protector himself. It was then that she saw the black creature at her side.

"Do not be afraid!" he called. "Your eyes do not deceive you: it is your friend Meldrake who flies with you."

"But . . . how is this possible?" Glynis said at last. "I was having a little daydream, that's all."

"Indeed. It is a dream we now share, not just among ourselves, but with all the creatures of this earth."

"What do you mean? How can we share a dream, Meldrake?"

"It's simple, really. If any cow on a hillside looked up from her cud and saw us right now, she would see two creatures, birds in fact, one black and one white, soaring overhead. This wouldn't trouble her in the least, as flying is simply what birds do, and she would return to her grazing with nary a second thought of it."

"Oh, so I'm supposed to believe that I'm a bird now, am I?" Glynis said, rather sarcastically.

"Don't listen to me, girl. Listen to your own eyes. What do they tell you?"

Up until that point, Glynis been focused on the dream-scene below, that glorious view that stretched from one horizon to the next. At Meldrake's suggestion she turned her eyes on her own self, and what a surprise she got! Her fingers, which moments before she had imagined waving gracefully through the air, were now become long white feathers! Her arms, which she had visualized as long and graceful limbs a moment ago, had transformed into that, and more. Indeed, they had transformed into wide wings!

Seeing all this, Glynis couldn't stop herself from laughing. /I've done it!/ she thought. /I have become Avis the Ocean Bird, that I had only dreamed of!/ Still laughing, she turned to Meldrake, who was watching her with amusement.

"I've done it, Meldrake!" she cried. "I've become the Ocean Bird, just like I said I would!"

"Indeed you have, Avis," replied the giant raven, "and not a moment too soon, I think. Now at least I can give you and your friend a proper tour. Let us return to the Great Tree, and on the way we shall see just how much you can do with those wings, my dear!"  Meldrake laughed at this last comment, and in the next blink of a bird's eye, he was gone!

Glynis looked all around for her friend. Soaring as high over the forested realm as she was, she couldn't see where the raven had gone. A brief flash of panic entered her mind as she scanned the skies frantically for something, anything, that might resemble the shaggy Meldrake. To think that she could lose track of a creature of his size, and in a mere instant!

Realizing that flying along in a straight line was of little use when she didn't know where she was going, Glynis decided to search for the Tree instead. If indeed it was her "Terminus Mundi," as Meldrake had said, she ought to be drawn back to it in some way or other, even if only because she had a pretty good sense of direction. This was thanks in part to her many jaunts through the woods surrounding her home back in Lake William.

The first thing to do, in any case, was to regain her bearings. With that in mind, Glynis broke course to the left and began tracing long, slow loops across the morning sky, scanning the ground below for a high hill.  Atop that high hill would be a meadow of sorts, and in the heart of that meadow? A great, dark tree, a maple, very much like the ones back home, and in fact it /was/ her home, "away from home" as it were.

This went on for some moments. As her search wore on, she began to relax a bit, growing more and more accustomed to her new birdish form.

Just exactly how she had managed such a transformation was beyond her, or at least her rational, thinking mind. Yet she was able to glean some information from the experience just the same, and as her body soared ever outward, her mind turned inward to focus on those few things which she could know and trust as true.

And what were those truths? What elements of her experiences thus far could she take as observable fact, given the fantastical nature of these last days?

She replayed in her mind as much as she could remember of what had just occurred, and her observations were these: First, she had focused on her breathing, specifically on deep breaths which filled the belly. Second, and in large part following from the first, she had calmed her usually over-active mind, so that rather than bouncing from one thought to another quickly, her mind had remained with the breathing, synchronizing itself in some way she didn't yet understand.

Third, once her breathing and quietness of mind were in place, she had begun articulating her hands and arms spontaneously, without any rhyme or reason at all, but in a way that she enjoyed nonetheless. In fact, she had enjoyed the entire process; the difficulty had lain in getting herself to slow her breathing in the first place. The rest had followed from there.

Just then her reverie was interrupted by a shadow falling across her face; just as quickly, it was gone. She knew somehow that it was Meldrake, but when she looked up, he was nowhere to be seen. "That crafty old bird," she thought. "He's been following me this whole time, the sneak!" She decided to leave the matter of her transformation (and all other things magical) as an open question to be investigated later. At the moment, she quite literally had a bird to catch.

And so Glynis lifted her wings and climbed. And kept climbing. She had been flying slowly along, content to remain at roughly the altitude she'd flown at with Meldrake. Now she abandoned all that, each turn bringing her ever higher above the forest below.

/I'll see what this body can do/, she thought, still unsure that it was in fact her own body, though it was, in every single way that mattered, as she would soon discover. Meanwhile, she rode the currents in the lower atmosphere up and up, ever higher, above the low wisps of cloud, above even the tops of the high mountains.

It was there, at the top of the world, with the clouds beneath her feet, that Glynis caught her first glimpse of the raven. Though he was nothing more than a black speck at first, she could see him there, some good ways below her. Helping her visibility was the blue water below. To her surprise, she found that she and Meldrake now flew above an enormous lake, the biggest Glynis had ever seen. Even at that height, it was clearly an enormous body of water, likely miles across.

Glynis was so taken in by the lake, which had appeared as if from nowhere, that she nearly lost track of the black dot which was Meldrake. She was determined not to let him get away so easily this time, however, and she quickly sighted him again, and dove, closing on his location with astounding speed. After all, she had never been a bird before, much less a dart plummeting from the heavens. As such, she found the speed thrilling but more than a little unnerving, requiring constant course corrections in order to track her target which --wonder of wonders-- was beginning to look something like an actual bird.

As the dark figure of Meldrake began to loom ever larger in her view, it occurred to Glynis that she might want to slow down at some point. It also occurred to her that she had absolutely no idea how to do so.

Meldrake, for his part, was simply "puttering along," as he might have put it, enjoying his view of the Lake of Hounds, content to remain airborne and avoid the wild dogs which gave the place its name, living as they did in the woods along the lake's western edge.

"I suppose I should go and find that Avis and see what she's gotten herself into," he thought, not without amusement. "Some time alone in her new form is just what she needs, but I imagine she's had enough for one day," he added.

Meldrake had only just resolved to go and look for his friend when a bolt of white streaked past, headed straight for the lake below.

"Meldrake! Help!" Glynis cried. Her voice was quickly receding from Meldrake's hearing. "I don't know how to stop!"

They weren't very far from the lake's surface now. Meldrake, sensing the danger as his friend plummeted down and down, tucked in his wings with surprising quickness and dove head-first, an ebony rocket. Even as he did so, he began chanting a diving spell, the words of power which served to focus his mind on the target, who was after all also his friend:

#+begin_verse
/White streak, black streak/
/Down we go together!/
/Sizzle! Snap!  Thunder-crack!/
/Down we go forever!/
/Down I go to save my friend/
/To live up to my names:/
/And the black arrow strikes/
/Where the black heart aims!/
#+end_verse

Gravity had always been a friend of Meldrake's, bird though he was, and it proved that friendship true once again, propelling the raven down- and lake-ward at a dizzying rate. Fear quickened him as well, the fear that Glynis, in her inexperience, would spin wildly out of control, in which case he doubted he could save her in time.

None of that mattered now, however. Meldrake repeated the spell silently, intent upon his friend. He became a black arrow in his heart.

"Meldrake!" came the call once again, Glynis mere yards ahead now. The Lake of the Hounds, so majestic and serene from above, had grown to fill the horizon itself, its rough waters stretching from pole to pole across Glynis' field of vision, and indeed it was all her frightened mind could see.

Still Meldrake the black arrow fell down through frozen time. After what seemed to be an eternity, he reached his friend, and with little time to spare. He could see the whitecaps, each one distinct, as they rolled across the giant lake.

"I'm here, Avis!" he cried at last. "And there is little time. You must do as I say, my young friend! At a three-count, open your wings and lift your head, seeking out the sky. Where the head goes, the body follows! Ready?!"

"Ready!" Glynis shouted.

"One!"

"Two!"

"Three!"

At the third call of the raven, Glynis threw open her wings, hard. At the same time she lifted her eyes skyward and imagined herself as she had been only moments before, floating carelessly above the clouds. "Anything but that awful lake," she thought.

But the lake was not awful, and as it turned out, it was no more hungry for the bodies of Glynis and Meldrake than it was  for anything else which fell from the sky. It was, after all, just a lake, and with perhaps a few enchanted exceptions, a lake doesn't want anything at all except to be what it is. Or at least we can suppose, since we, humble creatures that we are, cannot know its mind, if indeed it has one.

In any event, in just one brief instant Glynis went from plunging streak to soaring ocean bird once again. She felt the air push hard against her wings as she climbed, free once more to roam the morning sky.

Meldrake had been beside her the whole time. Unlike our Glynis, however, he was an experienced, well, bird, and so he had had his eyes open throughout the dive and resulting swoop and climb. He noted that Glynis had indeed pulled up with only a foot, perhaps two, to spare. He quickly decided against telling her this.

Glynis could feel the wind under her wings again, and the warm sun. She turned and saw the shaggy black arc that was Meldrake to her right, floating along, as she imagined it, without a care in the world. She too was feeling buoyant at the moment: the near-crash had left her giddy, thrilled to be alive at all.

"Where to, Meldrake?" Glynis asked.

"Why, we do it again," was the raven's reply.

"Um, I'm sorry --what?"

"We dive once more, my friend. A shallow dive, but a dive nonetheless. Follow me, and do as I do!" cried black Meldrake, and he was off, diving once more toward the waters below.

Glynis, having only just had a good fright, was reluctant to dive again. But she didn't want to lose Meldrake again, and hated the thought of appearing to be weak (a trait she shared with most humans, I'm afraid). And so down she went. In her caution, she started down slowly, but as she soon found out, there is no "slow" diving, and anyway Meldrake was once again far below, his head start, and undoubtedly greater speed, giving him the advantage.

A moment later, as Glynis looked on, Meldrake opened his wings and turned his head skyward, pulling out of the dive easily. Glynis took that as her cue to do the same, and to her surprise it was much easier the second time around.

"Again!" cried Meldrake, some few hundred feet below. "To me!"

Glynis promptly dove, reaching her friend a few seconds later.

"Good," said the raven. "Fear hasn't conquered you, Avis." He had been circling, waiting for Glynis to dive. Now that she'd arrived, he began the flight back to the tree where they'd begun. As Glynis fell in beside him, he spoke:

"Twice now you have come to the realm of the White Bear and faced down your fears, whether they be in the form of strange creatures or, as we've just seen, brushes with death itself." Meldrake paused for a moment to let his words sink in. "I must admit to you now, Avis, that Redcloth, dread foe though he may be, and unworthy of trust, spoke the truth when he told you that others had come before.  Twelve indeed there were, and still are, that have come by secret ways into the magical realm. Of them, I have met only two, and briefly. Though I have been told they were of good heart, both succumbed to Redcloth ere they had stayed long in this place, victims of his foul tricks, some few of which you experienced on your last visit. As they were no pupils of mine, that is all I can say. Of the other ten I know nothing at all, save that they dwell now in the clutches of that one-eyed devil, serving only him, though in his malign cleverness he has no doubt convinced them that they serve themselves."

"So where are they, in a dungeon somewhere?" Glynis asked.

"No, not in a dungeon, or at least their bodies do not waste away, hidden behind iron and rock. In fact, they come and go every bit as much as they please, and would no doubt tell you so, if asked. No, my dear Avis, their dungeons-- and the horrors within-- they create for themselves, with the help of the trickster Redcloth."

"I see," said Glynis. "It makes sense. When he spoke to me, it was with his mind, and it kind of had a way of making my brain itch. I really can't put it any better than that. It probably isn't too long a road from projecting your voice into someone else's head to making them believe it's their own."

"Well put, Avis," Meldrake replied. "You are aware of more than you first realize, it seems. So it is with Redcloth: his victims, strangers to this world and unschooled in its ways, do not have the command of mind or of Magick Verse to withstand such a one. Truly, it is only after much study in a hard school, many hours spent burning the midnight oil, studying at books of verse, herbcraft and number, that one might have the knowledge to face a Redcloth. Then, of course, there is the matter of experience. Let it suffice to say, my good Avis, that you were extremely lucky to have come through your encounter unscathed, thank Jelec! Had you been but further away from your Terminus Mundi, we would now be counting thirteen souls in Redcloth's dungeon!"

Glynis listened quietly to the raven as he spoke, intent on learning whatever she could from his words.

Meanwhile, they had been flying to the west, their backs to the morning sun, at least assuming that west was still west, and that the mechanics of the sun's rise and fall were the same as on Earth. Having left the giant Lake of Hounds behind, they were now crossing once again the dark forested hills, broken here and there by clearing and meadow.

"How much further, Meldrake?" Glynis asked.

"A little ways still," replied Meldrake.

"In that case, I have a question."

"Please share it," said the raven.

"What can you tell me about Verse, Herbcraft and Number?"

"Ah! Well. Herbcraft is a foundational magick, a science of the earth and those things that grow in it. Alone among the Three Pillars, it predisposes itself not only to talent but to study and hard work, at least in the beginning. This is not to say that the other two are easy. They are not! With the right herbs a practitioner can mix medicines that dull pain and heal infection, as well as the deadliest of poisons. Of course, it also has its mundane uses, such as the mixing of paint and other common things -- but listen to me, and my talk of 'common things!' Even the dullest coat of paint, if it is to last through snow, wind and rain, must possess many special properties that allow it to endure. Beyond that, we expect this 'common' paint to hold its hue throughout years of service! Truly, Avis, you or I would have to endure many moons under the strict apprenticeship of an Herbmaster before we had any hope of creating such a 'common' bucket of paint, and even then we might fail."

"That sounds a lot like the way things work back home, as far as I can tell," said Glynis.

"Indeed. It is the way things work in every place I have ever been to or heard described. We must never forget the wisdom of even common things!" he added.

"And what about the other two, Verse and Number?"

"Verse Magick is sometimes called the bowstring that fires the arrow of mind. It is best in all those things which by their nature require intent with a focused will. A line of verse, well-made, has the ability to imbue its creator with those qualities which it is intended to evoke; and which, in reality, she already has, even if she knows it not. By the same token a badly composed couplet might, in its folly, expose its creator to whatever ill fruit it bears. Many accidents and unhappy truths have been revealed in this way. For as we have spoken of several times now, there are no accidents, and words are powerful artifacts, creating and destroying at every turn. In this way the Verse Magick is the most dangerous to its wielder, since it can reveal truths the speaker would prefer stayed hidden. Others can read his thoughts, so to speak, by gleaning those truths from the spaces between the words. Or so we believe here," he added.

"Can you give me an example?" asked Glynis.

Meldrake thought it over for a moment. "Here is a little quatrain that I sometimes use to begin my meditations:

#+begin_verse
/The candle lights the table/
/The scabbard on the board/
/The mind is not the cable cut/
/The mind it is the sword/
#+end_verse

As you can hear for yourself, it is no great work of literature, merely a small device that serves to focus one's efforts, as well as an invocation."

"An invocation of what?" asked Glynis.

"Why, the sword of the mind, naturally. It is an image that works well for me, I think. No doubt another would be best for you, but that is the whole point of the thing, is it not?"

Glynis nodded her assent. "And what about Number?"

"The art of Number is an art of great power indeed. With it a practitioner can construct the most elaborate mental representations, beginning with but a few clear axioms which are used to derive the whole, each layer of the structure resting on the one below. This is known as the "internal art" for just that reason, and it sharpens the mind like no other. All ambiguity, all inconsistency is burned away as one approaches a state of pure reason.

"Beyond that, of course, there are the practical applications, with their own implications. The study of Number is a great tree, with many branches. The Numbermaster can perform such varied feats as: measuring and navigating over great distances using only a few bits of information (this is the lore of the triangle); estimations and calculations affecting the material world, the mixing of various formulae, tinctures, and herbal compounds, the design and construction of buildings (cottages to castles); also, the determination of probability and chance: which cards turn up, and when, in the games; how likely a battery of archers will be to hit a distant target; what are the chances that certain herbal cures will be effective based upon study of their effects in the past; and so on, and on and on. For these reasons, and many others, the Numbermaster is in demand as an advisor on many matters. Though it must be said that the study is both too broad and too deep for any one mind to have mastered the whole. Rather, it is an endless maze with an unknown prize at the center, where one door opens onto another, and another..."

Meldrake trailed off.

"But here we are."

Glynis looked down and saw what the great raven saw: surrounded by the ever-present pine forest, a grassy hill set in a clearing, and atop it, a maple tree and her friend John.

"We're back!" she cried.

"Indeed. Now follow me," said Meldrake. He immediately fell into a dive, and Glynis followed suit, though her speed was not yet a match for his. He then broke upward as he neared the top of the great tree, burning off momentum by turning slow circles around it, finally landing at the foot of the tree with a gentle thud. Glynis' landing was rather rougher, but she managed.

John, for his part, was waiting for them there. He looked at them, but did not say anything.

"Hey John! You'll never guess what I've been doing!" Glynis said, smiling.

"He doesn't recognize you," said Meldrake. "Nor can he understand you," he added. "You must return to your human form; right now you are a bird, and are speaking the language of birds."

"What are you talking about, Meldrake?"

"Do you think that's English you're speaking right now? Do you think these are English words that I speak? Look at your friend, and hear what his face is telling you."

Glynis turned to John, and just as Meldrake had suggested, he was simply the picture of confusion.

"John? It's me, John," she tried. John looked back at her, perplexed.

* THE NUMBERMASTER'S HALL

Glynis turned immediately to Meldrake. "What do I do? How do I change back?"

Meldrake gave a little bird-chuckle. "You changed yourself once; only you can bring yourself back."

Stymied, Glynis returned to her own mind for answers. She felt, as before, the inexplicable pull of the tree, and so she went and sat under it as a bird sits, in order to think. She closed her eyes and brought her mind into sync with her breath, as she had done before. For some reason she wanted to think about her fingers, and with her eyes still closed, she imagined opening and closing and wiggling them around. She had the same thoughts about her toes a moment later, and so she wiggled them too for good measure.

"G -- uh, Avis! It's you!" It was the voice of John, and it made her open her eyes again to find herself, the same old Glynis, sitting under the same old tree with her friends John and Meldrake looking on.

"I guess I'm back," she said, and stood to join her friends. She was pleased to note that in all the excitement over transforming into bird-form, nearly dying in the great Lake of Hounds, and then having her first diving lesson, her trusty red bookbag had done its duty, and her items of precious cargo remained intact. Her grandmother's ruby brooch was the most valuable of the three, naturally, and she breathed a sigh of relief that it was safe and sound and ready to be returned to her mother's jewelry box as soon as was humanly (or otherwise) possible.

"So, what's our next move, Meldrake?" asked the now Glynis-girl (as opposed to the former Glynis-hawk).

"Why, we set out upon the woodland path, of course. The day has just begun, and I know of a little farm that we might reach in a half-hour's walk, and what's more, I think we can convince my good friend the farmer Kell to give us some breakfast."

"I like the sound of that," said John, rubbing his stomach.

"Me too," added Glynis.

"Let us be off, then!" cried Meldrake, who seemed to be in high spirits (as was usual for him, Glynis supposed). He set off down the grassy path that led down the hill, away from the great maple, and into the surrounding forest. As they crossed the threshold into woodland, the grassy path became a carpet of pine needles and leaves, even as the forest floor some feet away from the path was invisible under thick cover of ferns. It all reminded Glynis so much of her own forests back in Lake William that she began to feel right at home, and she turned and smiled at John, who was bringing up the rear of their little party, and who for his part smiled back, clearly enjoying their new surrounds and the adventure thus far.

Glynis decided that now, with a bit of a walk ahead of them, was as good a time as any to tell John about her maiden flight and her brush with disaster. He was particularly interested, as anyone at all would be, in how exactly his boring old friend Glynis was suddenly able to change into a bird and take flight -- and what's more, then to engage in bird-talk with her fellow avian creatures, as if the rest hadn't been strange enough already!

"I wonder if I'll get to change into something," John murmured as they walked along the trail, some minutes after Glynis had finished telling her story.

"That would be fun," observed Glynis.

"Perhaps," said Meldrake. "Although it remains to be seen, and in any event is not guaranteed to anyone, ever. In fact, even if you've transformed in the past, there is no way to know if you will be able to do it again, or at a time and place of your choosing. It is said by some who are called wise here that this quality of uncertainty is a blessing that forces you to focus on what is, which is to say only and ever the present. The philosophers of this school deem it sheerest folly to concern oneself overmuch with past or future, which are but castles of the mind -- or so they say; I have some old aches and scars that would beg to differ! With regards to transformation, experience and teaching suggest that it is a gift you can prepare yourself to receive. It is nonetheless a gift in that it is freely given, and cannot be coerced. Though it may, I must admit, be coaxed along a bit," he added ruefully.

"Is there any way of knowing in advance what I'd change into?" asked John.

"There are some who claim to be able to tell you, usually for a 'small fee' of some kind. They are mostly disregarded, save by fools. The truth, friend-of-Avis, is that it depends upon what secret longings lurk within you, which we might call your true nature."

"Does it have to be an animal form?" asked Glynis, who had obvious reason to want to know the answer.

"Yes and no; all of animalkind, yourselves included, have connections one to each other that run deep: streams from a single source, and all that. Nothing new there, really. When some creatures change, however -- and remember: it is not guaranteed!-- the things which are revealed are twisted, dark. Abominations, some would no doubt call them, though in reality they are but different forms -- streams which, though brackish and unfriendly to most living things, nonetheless flow from the same central spring. Even so, they are dangerous, and if left unchecked to roam and rampage as they will, these creatures will bring suffering to all in their path."

"So the short answer is: 'Not exactly'," said Glynis

"Correct," Meldrake said with a chuckle. "Forgive me; I'm long-winded both by training and inclination, as you've no doubt observed by now. Let us continue our walk in silence, then."

This suited John and Glynis nicely, as they often went for long walks in the woods and mountains near their home, though not often in such strange company!

Thus did the three companions make their way along the woodland path. It was full morning by now, with the bright sun coming into its own, and yet the woods through which the three traveled were still deep in shade; the great stands of pine, cedar and spruce competed jealously for the light high overhead, so that only a few broken rays made their way to the carpet of ferns below. Here and there one might spy a small clearing far from the path. Glynis guessed that, if indeed these forests were anything like the ones she knew, she would find wild flowers and birches along the edges of those clearings, since birch trees in particular love to seek out the new places, and are ever to be found where field and forest meet.

It wasn't long before Glynis began to spy the edge of a field through the trees some way ahead. Despite his bird's legs and massive size, Meldrake was capable of a surprisingly brisk pace on foot. Moments later the three emerged from the forest shade into morning sun once again, and were brought up short by a stone wall. Set in the wall before them was a wooden door reinforced with black iron. The distinguishing feature of this door was its shape: that of a hexagon. In fact, upon closer inspection, Glynis could see that the stones laid into the wall itself were cut into hexagons, which were then neatly stacked to create a "honeycomb" pattern something like this:

[Figure 6.0]
[[./img/6.0.jpg]]

"These stones are amazing!" exclaimed the usually reticent John Sharp. "Look how close the cuts are. I bet they didn't even need mortar," he marveled as he traced the shape of one hexagonal block with a finger. John's father was a builder in the Lake William area, who often took young John along to help with his various projects, mostly homes along the lake, when school was out, and as a result John maintained a more-than-passing interest in such things.

"We have reached the abode of the Farmer Kell," announced Meldrake to no one in particular. Turning to John, he said simply, "Mortar is for round stones and the lazy," to which he soon added, "and if there is one thing to be said of Kell, he is anything but lazy. Now, where is that dratted bell? Ah, here it is."

Meldrake reached up with a huge black wing and grasped a rope that hung down over the side of the wall, suspended by an iron frame, and which was attached, one presumed, to a bell on the other side. Though it could just as likely have been attached to a cauldron of boiling oil, or a box of rocks, for that matter. Luckily for Glynis and friends, the rope was pulled, the bell rang, and any encounters with boiling oil were postponed for a later date.

Several moments passed. Judging by the size of the section of wall before them, Glynis imagined that Kell's farm was a good-sized operation, and depending upon how much help the man had -- if in fact he was a man and not some other sort of creature -- there would be a bit of a wait. Meldrake was apparently under no such illusions, however, and he reached for the rope and rang the bell again. And again. And a third time! He was behaving like an impatient child, Glynis thought.

"Meldrake!" cried Glynis. "Aren't you being a little, um, impatient?"

"Nonsense! I am waiting for my breakfast! And when one is waiting for one's breakfast, patience is anything but a virtue!"  Meldrake turned and lifted his wing as if to ring the bell a fourth time. Just then a small opening was revealed in the center of the door. The opening, which was also shaped, as you might have guessed, like a hexagon, allowed a voice to escape, and here is what it had to say: "*WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE, DISTURBING THE PEACE OF MY HOME?!*"

Neither Glynis nor John was sure how to reply, but as usual, Meldrake had something to say, though at that moment Glynis rather wished he hadn't.

"Why, Kell," said the raven, "you cranky old cowsitter. I demand that you open this door at once, as it is time for my breakfast."  He turned and winked a birdly wink at his two companions, and would probably have smirked as well, if he could have figured out how to do so with a beak in the way.

The voice of Kell was not amused.

"*LEAVE THIS PLACE AT ONCE. YOU ARE NOT WELCOME HERE AT ALL, FOR BREAKFAST OR ANYTHING ELSE.*"

Meldrake responded in kind:

#+begin_verse
/Said the dormouse to the wind/
/Kell gets fat while his cows stay thin!/
/To which the wind replied/
/It should be a sin!/
/I'll battle and blow 'til his house falls in!/
/I'll bring thunderclaps down upon his kin!/
/To think: Getting fat while your cows stay thin!/
#+end_verse

This he did with a rhythm and pitch that Glynis would describe as "sing-song," and it reminded Glynis more than anything else of a small child's playground taunt. It seemed designed to irritate, and Glynis was surprised to see Meldrake using his powers of verse in this way. She only hoped that this Kell, whomever he was, wouldn't get too angry.

Her hopes in that regard soon faded, as the voice's response was swift.

"*LOOK TO THE WALLS ABOVE YOU, INTERLOPERS. YOU WILL BEGIN TO SEE ARCHERS APPEAR THERE MOMENTARILY. AT MY COMMAND, THEY SHALL TALKE SUCH ACTION AS WILL PUNCTURE YOUR ARROGANT HIDES. FOR THE LAST TIME: GO.*"

Upon hearing this, Meldrake couldn't stop himself laughing. After he had cackled away for a moment, he began (to Glynis' horror) to sing again.

It was a new rhyme:

#+begin_verse
Kell the Farmer's round the bend,
Doesn't recognize a friend!
Hides behind his walls and threats,
What hospitality his vis'tors get,
When at his gates they beg for cake,
Can't you spare a few crumbs for your friend MELDRAKE?
#+end_verse

As Meldrake incanted the last line, he spread his wings low at his sides, took a step back with one leg, and performed a low bow in the direction of the gate. Glynis thought it looked rather solemn and formal, in odd contrast with his previous manner. Both she and John looked to the gate, awaiting a response from the creature inside.

A few seconds later, after some rattling of bolts being undone and locks being opened, or so Glynis imagined, the door swung open to reveal a short, rather gnomish-looking fellow with a full, black beard, wearing green pants and a red coat. To Glynis' surprise, he wore a smile as well.

Meldrake, unsurprisingly, was the first to speak: "Why Kell, you suspicious fool, I was wondering when you were going to let me in."

Kell responded in his gruff voice. "Meldrake, if you weren't cursed with that damned birdbrain of yours, you'd know there are easier ways of getting a seat at my breakfast table. No matter. I'm mostly used to your foolishness by now," he added, and then turned his attention to Glynis and John, who were waiting patiently to be introduced.

"May I present my new friend Avis and her associate?" said Meldrake, cutting him off. "I've been showing them around a bit, you see."

"Greetings," said Kell as he removed his green hat and bowed slightly.

Glynis and John replied with their own, rather more awkward bows, to which Kell nodded in assent.

"Very well then. Why don't you all come inside for some breakfast?" asked Kell.

"I thought you'd never ask," replied the raven.

Kell stepped back through the six-sided door of his compound and held it open, beckoning them to enter.

Glynis and John could scarcely have prepared themselves for what they saw. They found themselves on a stone path that traveled from under their feet in a great circle around the walled property, hewing as closely to the hexagonal wall as a circle could be expected to. In the roughly triangular spaces left between the circle's arc and the points of the hexagon, flowerbeds were laid.

Glynis noted that the stones on which she stood were themselves circles, in keeping with the geometry of the space. Looking up, she could see what appeared to be the main house a few hundred yards ahead. It was tall and shaped like a triangle set on a base narrower than its height, with large windows in front, themselves in the shapes of triangles. The overall effect was not unlike that of some houses Glynis had seen in the mountains around Lake William, miniature ski lodges built in the "alpine" style.

As Kell led the three hungry companions along the path, it became clear to Glynis that they were in fact on the outermost of a series of concentric circles; at their epicenter, strange and angular thing though it was, sat Kell's cottage. The method for traveling from the outer wall to the house seemed to be this: walk the circle in either direction, come to a path directed inward, turn onto said path until the next circle is reached, at which point, walk the circle in either direction, come to a path directed inward, and so on, until you reach your destination.

[Figure 6.0a]
[[./img/6.0a.jpg]]

Though the above method of travel is repetitive, it was not without its rewards. Meldrake, presumably used to the sights and sounds of Kell's strange farm, remarked on them not at all. Instead, he carried on a lively chat with Kell, who as the host and Lord of the Manor, led the way for the others. This freed John and Glynis to bring up the rear, and as they did, here is some part of what they saw: in the outermost ring, six shaggy black ponies, grazing on the long grass; in the next ring, a dozen or so cows, black, brown, and white; then a ring or corn, the better to fatten the cows; a ring of alfalfa, used to make hay for the horses; a ring of pigs, and one of chickens; a ring of scattered trees, a sort of small park for Kell's enjoyment (and that of his family, we must suppose, should any such family exist); within the last concentric ring, nearest to the house itself, a vegetable garden the likes of which Glynis had never seen, except in the pages of books. Surrounded by wooden framing and latticework, there hung a multitude of tomato vines, green beans, and the beautiful espalired fruit trees ran along wires wherever the vines exhausted themselves.

John was the first of the two friends to speak. "This is an amazing place, Mr. Kell."

"Thank you," Kell said with a slight nod. "Perhaps you'd all like some breakfast. Follow me." Continuing down the path, he led them to the house itself. As they discovered, great triangular windows at each end opened onto a large elevated deck, from which Kell could presumably survey his property at a glance, not to mention the forest's edge, and beyond that the nearby hills and distant mountains.

All of this became evident to Glynis as she climbed the steps up to the deck behind Meldrake; they reached the top to find a table and four chairs awaiting them. To the newcomers' amazement, four settings had been laid out, and several plates of food filled the table's center.

"That didn't take long," commented Meldrake as he surveyed the table before him. "Perhaps you've been expecting us for a while? If I know you, this table was set when we were still ten minutes' walk away. Could it be that the great Numbermaster Kell is not so hateful of visitors as his reputation would have the world believe?"

Kell cracked something resembling a smile through his beard. "Surely you understand, old friend. If I were to receive every fool and his brother who showed up at my gate, I'd never get anything done."

"Well, I suppose I should be honored," said Meldrake. "O, to sit at table with the Great and Glorious Kell, master of shapes, tamer of numbers and cows!" This last he exclaimed with more than a touch of his mocking sarcasm.

"Oh, put a stopper in it," grumbled Kell, "Let's all just sit down and have some breakfast. Sit wherever you like," he added for the children's benefit. "Just don't bother about that dirty old thing you'll be sharing the table with." He said, jutting his chin in Meldrake's direction. John and Glynis laughed, which Meldrake studiously ignored.

As everyone was settling themselves at the table, Glynis saw that the plates and dishes were also of various geometric shapes. There were octagonal pot pies and hexagonal omelettes. It seemed to her that there was no end to Kell's affection for geometry and all its forms -- and she was right. Once all had been seated comfortably, Kell addressed her directly.

"So Avis, Meldrake has told you of some of our various fields of study, has he not?" His previously gruff and reticent nature had apparently been discarded in order to allow for mealtime conversation.

"A little bit. Number, herb and verse were the ones he mentioned. I imagine there must be more."

"Yes, many. As you've no doubt guessed, I am a student of number. Specifically, of geometry, which is sometimes called the art of arranging number in space."

Glynis nodded as he continued.

"Unfortunately, my field of interest, more than some others, tends to overlap with many more practical, and even dangerous matters."

"How so?" asked John. Glynis was surprised; she hadn't heard him speak much in the few moments since they'd arrived at the house.

"There's always work for a good geometer," he replied. "Or a 'mathematician' of any stripe, really. That is what your people call it?"

John and Glynis both nodded.

"Sadly much of the paying work has to do with the black art of war." Kell smiled grimly. "Development of arms. Smithing techniques. Heavy weapons. Fortifications. Fields of fire. Artillery calculations. All of these and more can be improved using what are in many cases simple calculations."

"A student of Number must be on his guard at all times. Many are those who would exploit what a geometer knows for their own gain without troubling themselves to understand what it is that brings that gain. They'd think nothing of extracting that knowledge at the point of a sword -- that is why I live as I do, surrounded by high walls and forest."

"A dangerous profession, to be a man of knowledge," added Meldrake.

Kell nodded gravely. Seconds passed in awkward silence. "Well, on that note, let us eat heartily," cried Meldrake, returning at once to his usual joviality.

"Yes, let's," was all their host had to say to that.

The hungry travelers set upon the well-furnished table like a pack of hounds. For some minutes not a voice was heard at table, only the sounds of fork against plate, tooth against meat.

After a time, the farmer spoke again, beckoning John and Glynis to pay heed with a grunt and a wave of his hand. In front of him was an apple pie in the shape of a hexagon, much like this:

[Figure 6.1]
[[./img/6.1.jpg]]

"We have a small problem. There are four of us here. Clearly we'll need four pieces of pie. The trouble is, I dislike serving oddly-shaped pieces of pie to my guests; only squares or triangles will do. What do you suggest? How should I cut this pie?"

Glynis was the first with a question. "Do we have to use the whole pie?"

"Good question," replied Kell. "No."

"And the pieces should be the same size," added John. In order to be polite, Kell nodded.

A few moments passed as Glynis and John each mulled over the problem. Glynis, for her part, was the rare sort of person who manages always to have pencil and paper at the ready, and this case was no exception. As you will recall, she had, at Meldrake's request, brought with her three very powerful items: a token of her family line, a book whose wisdom she lived by, and a song for a dark time. Like many other young girls her age, she carried her books to school every day in a red nylon bookbag. When the occasion came to honor Meldrake's request, she of course reached for the same red bookbag she was used to carrying to school each day, and she was just the sort of person to slip in a notebook and pencils alongside the other three items he'd asked her to bring.

As such, she was able to supply John and herself with pencils and half-sheets of paper from her notebook, and they immediately began sketching out diagrams of hexagons. Thus aided, each began disecting hexagon into square and triangle variously.

John's method was what one might call the "thousand flowers" school: he quickly filled up his halfsheet with a dozen or so tiny hexagons, and set about sectioning them into the asked-for squares and triangles.

Glynis was of a different mind than her friend, and as such, instead of filling her paper with various experimental solutions, drew a single, neat figure in the center. She then set her pencil down and turned her full attention to the shape before her on the table. We might call hers the "single combat" approach; in fact, she appeared to be doing nothing at all so much as having a staring contest with a piece of paper.

Glynis was the first with an answer. "I think I have it, Kell," she said.

"Show me."

Glynis picked up her pencil again. "We need four pieces, each the same size. I started by cutting the pie in half, like this:

[Figure 6.2]
[[./img/6.2.jpg]]

You said you like serving perfect triangles or rectangles, though, so my first thought, to cut the pie like this,

[Figure 6.3]
[[./img/6.3.jpg]]

was wrong."

"Clearly," said Kell through a beard spotted with crumbs.

"Then I figured that if I wanted to get triangles, I had to draw the lines through the corners like so:

[Figure 6.4]
[[./img/6.4.jpg]]

"That gave me lots of triangles to play with, but since we're talking about pie here, I figured bigger pieces were better, so I settled on this:

[Figure 6.5]
[[./img/6.5.jpg]]

"Good work," said Kell. "I'd find those pieces of pie acceptable to serve to my guests." He lifted the sheet of paper Glynis had been working from and handed it to Meldrake, who nodded in agreement. "Highly acceptable, I should think," said the black creature.

Then Glynis, Kell, and Meldrake turned to John, who seemed a bit startled to have the eyes of the entire table upon him at once, and he laughed.

"It's O.K., everyone. I've got a solution, too," he said with a smile. "After a few experiments, I came up with this:

[Figure 6.6]
[[./img/6.6.jpg]]

"This gives us four equal pieces of pie with plenty left over. After seeing Avis's solution, though, I realized something: the hexagon is really just a group of six equally sized triangles grouped together, each pointing inward, like this:

[Figure 6.7]
[[./img/6.7.jpg]]

"Aha!" cried Meldrake. "You've seen through one solution to a general case! Congratulations, young sir."

"And to you," said Kell to Glynis, in a low voice, "for getting the result that made a small insight possible." He then turned his attention to the pie in front of him, and with his knife he cut it into the six equilateral triangles described by John. Four of these he doled out to the companions gathered there at the table, and they ate heartily as the morning drew on.

* SILVERBIRD AND THE STARLING KING

#+begin_verse
/Come with me to a Sacred Grove!/
/O'er hillock, stream and dale we'll roam./
/Providence's favored children/
/Never found so much to thrill them:/
/Heirloom, book, and song alike!/
/The raven's cry shall sound tonight!/
/And if the questions rise up in your throat/
/Press on, my friends! The game's afloat!/
/Yes, when the questions rise up in your throat/
/Step Lively, friends! The game's afloat!/
#+end_verse

With those words Meldrake had enjoined Glynis and John to action: specifically, that they journey with him to a place of his knowledge, that they might learn of the reasons for Glynis' need of the three items Meldrake had asked of her. These were, as the reader may recall, a token of the McGinty family line, a book whose wisdom Glynis lived by, and finally a "Song for a Dark Time." This last, rather cryptic item had been the most difficult for Glynis to choose, and in the end she had settled upon, not a song, but a poem. In fact, it was one which her mother had read to her ever since she was a little girl, and which gave her a sort of comfort each time she heard it. But we shall hear more about that later.

All things considered, the trio's breakfast with the good, gruff Farmer Kell had gone well enough, and they had resumed their stroll in the woods with rested legs, full bellies, and an invitation from the cow-tending Numbermaster himself to return at their leisure. Glynis, for her part, hoped to be in possession of more mathematics by the time they returned, the better to attack the puzzles which Kell would surely have waiting for her.

Not very long after they had left the house of Kell, they reentered the woods by another path from another gate. It was then that Meldrake's aforementioned call rang out clear and bright, exhorting them to a undertake a journey to a sacred grove, various adventures therewith, et cetera.

Thus it was that Glynis, the eldest daughter of the McGinty family and the only member (to her limited knowledge) ever to speak the language of birds, found herself traipsing along a woodland path behind a giant raven in a land that was not her own.

Rather than keep to the easier pace of the earlier leg of their journey, it seemed Meldrake had decided that now was the time for haste. In fact, the two human children were having some difficulty in keeping up with their avian friend, and were forced to break into a light jog from time to time in order to do so.

"Come friends! The Sun travels quickly! The mouse is in the pantry! First foot, second foot, dispense with oliphantry!" came the call from the forest ahead.

Meldrake had outpaced his friends for the moment, and all Glynis could see was the needle-covered path as it disappeared into the black pines. She wondered if she should tell him that "oliphants" were probably faster than he seemed to think: she remembered reading an article about elephants in school which claimed a top speed of more than twenty miles per hour! She was debating whether to share this fact with Meldrake when John appeared at her side.

In the course of their explorations of the woods and mountains of Lake William, they had developed a simple shorthand using eye and hand movements to cut down on the need for speaking. On more than one occasion they had spent several hours sitting quietly at the edge of a meadow or pond, watching the world go by, as it were. Often, they found that if they were very silent, and very still, then the animals would return after some time had passed. Once it was clear that the two of them posed no threat, all sorts of wonderful things would happen: birds would return to their normal calls and songs, squirrels would resume their endless searching for acorns and other winter foods, and occasionally even that most timid of woodland creatures, the white-tailed deer, would make an appearance. Meanwhile the two friends would sit and take in their surroundings, loathe to do anything that might dissuade the creatures in the forest around them from paying a visit.

And so it was that John was able to silently direct Glynis' attention to the sky. With his eyes, he directed her to a point some distance ahead of them on the path. Through the narrow opening in the trees she saw the thing that John had seen: it was a bird --no, several birds, all floating just above the treetops. Glynis couldn't make out their colors --at this distance they appeared to be black-- but she could tell that their attention was focused on something in the forest below, though it was too soon to tell just what. She gave John a look that said, "I've seen it," and another: "Thanks." His eyes flashed on the forest ahead, as if to say: "We should tell Meldrake." Glynis nodded.

"Meldrake." Glynis spoke the name clearly but quietly, stopping just short of a call. She was worried that her voice might carry too far, to the ears of those birds overhead. Worse, there could be other dangers as yet unseen, for the forest was thick and dark even in the day, and who could say for sure what creatures called it their home?

A moment later, Glynis heard footsteps coming from the trail ahead, and a moment after that, the raven himself appeared.

"Meldrake. There are birds overhead."

"As there should be, thank the Protector," was Meldrake's reply.

Glynis immediately felt foolish. "No, I meant to say: there are birds circling directly over the trail, a ways ahead."

As she said this, she immediately had one thought only: Redcloth!

"Could it be him? Redcloth?" she blurted out.

"Do not speak that name so freely!" Meldrake hissed. "Foolish child!"

#+begin_verse
/When the sun climbs high o'er the black things sleeping/
/fools and the innocent say what they say/
/Safe in the sun, safe from the sleeping ones/
/their words are as traps that the huntsman lays/

/Woe to the huntsman who his own traps lays!/
/Woe to the fool of the bright long day!/
#+end_verse

With that, Meldrake turned and began once more his brisk walk along the path. Glynis and John followed as before, each of them more curious than wary of what lay ahead. Certainly, good John had no real concern over this Redcloth character just yet, who was still no more than a name in a story Glynis had told him.

So the three kept walking, and before long they came to the place where the birds circled overhead, and could see just what the commotion was about.

There was, as Glynis had expected, a clearing in the forest. In the center of that clearing was a place where the granite underlying the forest floor had pushed up a strangely cylindrical tower some twenty or thirty feet high. Atop the resulting height there were perched two birds, which Glynis instantly imagined as male and female, though she had no evidence as of yet. The larger of the two, which Glynis had identified in her mind as the male, was black like Meldrake -- /and like the dread Redcloth, too!/ came the thought before she could banish it. Unlike Meldrake, however, his feathers were smooth against his body, and as Glynis peered more closely she could see the shimmering hues of a rainbow moving against the black of his coat as he moved.

Turning, Glynis caught a glimpse of a silver flash next to the bird she now recognized as a starling. In the next instant, the flash faded, and then returned, shimmering in and out of view as she looked on. It was a moment's work for her brain, which even poor Glynis would have admitted had been well-taxed by trying to make sense of all that she had seen so far while in the Land of the White Bear (that bear who, to our dear Glynis, seemed no more than a bogeyman at best, though she would later discover her error). Nevertheless, her poor brain did its best to make sense of the signals it was receiving from her eyes, and this is the sense it made:

The silver creature was a bird, alright. Or rather, it was shaped like a bird, albeit one which, for reasons unknown, was only really visible for a few blinks of the eye at a time. The rest of the time it was perceptible only as a shimmering object in space -- not transparent, but translucent perhaps. As for what Glynis' eye actually saw, it was something on the order of: bird (with head to the right), glimmering shape, glimmering shape, bird (with head turned leftward, beak open), shimmer, shimmer, flash; bird (standing with wings slightly opened), glimmer, blank, seated bird. The effect was disorienting, to say the least.

Glynis was so caught up in her examinations of the glimmering bird-shape that she failed to notice the quiet which had descended upon the clearing. The birds which had been circling overhead had landed, while those gathered in pockets around the stone outcropping had arranged themselves into a circle around the starling and silver bird. All eyes were on Glynis, Meldrake, and John as they stood dumb before the assembly. Meldrake, never one to avoid a chance for a dramatic moment, seemed to bathe in the collective silence for a moment before he spoke.

"Greetings, friends of the sky. For many years now the winged folk have been beset by a plague, a foul creature whose name I will not utter here, in the company of friends. In that time, a number of beings like my two companions here, for reasons and via paths which remain unknown to us, made their ways here, to the realm of the Great Recluse, the Protector, who is also the White Bear. To the dismay of much of birdkind, the poisoned one has captured many of these poor creatures, who are but children, and turned their minds against them, against their very selves and souls. Even now these innocents, who knew naught of our ways 'ere they stepped through our gates, are wasting in the dungeons of the cyclops. Even now they assist him in plotting our destruction, so clouded are their judgments from the tortures of the spirit which they've endured."

Meldrake's last words hung in the air for a moment. It was the large starling atop the granite pedestal who spoke first, which seemed fitting to Glynis, somehow.

"And what would you have us do, Meldrake? Your words would seem to counsel intervention, and no doubt battle -- and the very prisoners we go to save will instead fight against us. No doubt they would see us as invaders, and respond in kind, with all the magic at their disposal, and which their master has taught them. Are we to expect otherwise?"

Meldrake's answer was clear: "I bring you and yours nothing but trouble, my lord. Trouble and toil and death. I did not come here in search of those who, in the ease of the bright day, would spend their hours in leisurely play and be home in time for tea. I came for those who would die -- and yet live -- who would stand to hard service with no hope of joy at journey's end."

At that, a murmur arose from the assembled crowd, as the Starling King and Meldrake remained locked each in the other's steady gaze. It seemed clear to Glynis that Meldrake had intended all along to come here and to issue this challenge, though what part she was to play she did not yet know. She couldn't make out from the whisperings of the crowd whether they would humor the black challenger and his friends with praise or stones.

As Glynis turned over the question, the Silverbird, ethereal mate of the Starling King, began a low descent from her granite perch, simply stepping off of it into the gentle air, wings open. Down she floated, twenty feet to the ground, shimmering in and out of the naked eye's view. Her descent slow, her movements deliberate, she alighted not five feet from where Meldrake, Glynis, and John stood.

Meldrake bowed low, his folded wings brushing the ground, as the Silverbird approached and reached out with her wing to touch him. As she did so, the onlookers gathered there saw Meldrake change and begin to shimmer in and out of view in sync with the great Silverbird herself. Shimmer, blank, Meldrake bowed low. Glimmer, pop, and there he was again, wings outstretched, beak open as if letting forth a cry upon the mountain. And so on, until Meldrake and the Silverbird were each mere shimmering forms, varying configurations from one moment to the next.

Inside their now-shared experience -- which, when translated from the language of birds, is called "the place apart from all other places," or simply "the place apart," the Silverbird finally spoke, in a voice like chimes in the breeze.

"You seem so sure of yourself, raven."

"I am indeed. Indeed, when aren't I?"

"You've been sure before, and wrong."

"And I'll be sure again, and wrong," Meldrake teased.

"What is it that you see in this girl and her friend?"

"From a magical standpoint," Meldrake replied, "she has some minor gifts: transformation, a knowledge of her Terminus Mundi, its location and power. Nothing we haven't seen before, save one thing."

"Go on."

"She has met Redcloth, looked him in the eye, and spoken to him. She has been surrounded by him and his avatars and, without knowing the danger she was in, avoided his ensnarements. Also, she has a friend, while most who come through our gates do not."

"What of this friend?"

"There is little to tell. He has evidenced no abilities, save a rather mundane insight in Geometry while at Kell's for breakfast. Other than that, his primary skill seems to lie in following Avis around."

"And yet, you dismiss such power too easily, Meldrake -- you, who would seem wise."

"I don't understand, Teacher. The boy is quite ordinary, unremarkable. In fact, he rarely speaks."

"And yet he is a Friend. If he be true, that is a rare thing indeed. You, above all others, should know this, Meldrake."

"'/Rarer than gold, silver, or the power of kings, is a True Friend/.'"

"That is an old saying in these lands, though too often forgotten, even by me. That we might remember it better, Meldrake, I ask this of you: compose a verse on friendship, a few short lines to remind an errant heart. Share it with as many as you can."

* LONG RIVER'S EDGE

Glynis stood and watched as Meldrake disappeared into whatever other dimension it was that the SIlverbird, in her glorious strangeness, had taken him to. Like the rest of the company gathered there, feathered and non-, she was silent and perhaps even dumbfounded, intelligent girl though she was. When it became clear that the exchange with the Silverbird would last a few moments more than she could bear to stand in that uncomfortable place of searching eyes, she opened her mouth as if to speak. Before she could make utterance the deep voice of the Starling King broke the silence. She was surprised to find that he was addressing her and John, which she should not have been, but being in a very strange place, and surrounded by its very strange creatures, will have that effect on a person.

"Tell us your names, young travelers, that we might converse and share the histories of our lands," said the Starling King from his perch on high. All of this formal language was becoming a bit much for Glynis to take, but she supposed that kings had their own ways of doing things, or else they wouldn't be kings. Because of this, she decided to match formality with formality as best as she could.

"I am called Avis, which is a white dove, and also a portent," was her brief reply.

"And what shall we call you, young master?" asked the starling of John.

John's brow furrowed. Clearly he was unsure what to say in the presence of such royalty.

"My name is a secret," he said at last. "To reveal it would be a mistake. This is what I was told," he added by way of apology.

"You were told correctly," replied the starling. "As they say: 'by a little bird,' no doubt."

"This particular bird was rather large, actually," said John, to which the king replied with a chuckle: "Indeed. And yet we must call you something."

John nodded his agreement, his mind searching for an appropriate name. "/Avis's name is taken from the animal kingdom/," he thought, "/so why not mine?/" He knew right away which of all the animals he would choose. It was the one creature he loved most, and which he felt represented him well: the black bear, native to the forests of his home in Lake William. He remembered reading somewhere that its Latin name was "ursus Americanus."

"If you must have a name to use, call me 'Ursus,'" said John to the Starling King and the others assembled there. As he said his new name, he felt himself standing a bit taller than before. A new name can do that, especially if one chooses it for oneself.

"Tell me of this name," said the starling.

"'URsus americanus' is the black bear that is native to my home. It is not the largest of bears, nor the strongest or most fierce. Where I live, the black bear survives on nuts, berries, fish, and many things that humans discard as trash. This bear can run and climb trees more swiftly than any man, and as far as I know it has no predators other than man. Even so, it is not a proud creature, roaring and trampling about the forest without care. Black bears live in the secret places, and their knowledge of the forests they range is deep." John left it at that. He wasn't used to speaking with so many words, and it made him uncomfortable to go on so; he was like his father in that way.

The Great Starling nodded wordlessly. Perhaps he sensed the boy's discomfort, and chose not to torture him with further lordly talk?  None can say. Whatever the reason, he turned his gaze and voice back to Glynis.

"As for you, Avis, what are your hopes here? What of this notion of Meldrake's, that we of lesser bird-kind will rise up to vanquish our very own Redcloth? For he is ours, you know, a creation of this time and place. There are even some here who called themselves his friends, upon a time."

"I don't know," replied Glynis. "I met him only one time."

"What was your impression of him?" asked the starling.

"I was disturbed, I suppose. I found a nice tree to sit under. It protected me in some way."

"Yes, I have heard of this," said the bird-king. "You were fortunate, I think. You have yet to answer my first questions: What are your hopes here? What say you of Meldrake's desire to throw down this Redcloth?"

Glynis thought the king's questions were a little more insistent than is usually polite, at least according to the way she was raised, but she decided against saying so, especially with Meldrake having disappeared into the ther as he had.

"I honestly don't know what I hope will happen here," she said. "I only just came here, and I feel like I've been thrust into something I don't really understand. This place is not very much at all like the one I come from. As far as Meldrake wanting to free those children from Redcloth, I can't find a reason to disagree. Where I come from, you're supposed to protect children from people who mistreat them, whatever it costs."

Just then the air began to change, and there was a sizzling noise, like electrical wires. A small flash -- a snap, crackle, and pop! -- and Meldrake reappeared with the good Queen Silverbird just behind. No one was all that surprised, having witnessed such phenomena moments before, and so Glynis and John decided not to be surprised either.

The Silverbird gave Meldrake a brief nod of understanding, then spread her wings, rising to return to the side of her king. Meldrake turned to the children.

"We are dismissed. Let us go."

---

Several minutes passed before they had left the clearing far enough behind to be out of earshot. This time through the woods, they did not seem to be in any rush at all. Meldrake had returned to his former leisurely pace, and was now able to speak in something other than a rhyming verse. By now it was approaching noon, the noon of a clear day. Glynis' stomach rumbled in agreement that it was, in fact, high time for a nice lunch. She observed, as many do, that a finely-tuned stomach keeps its own exquisite time.

"So Meldrake, what was that all about?" Glynis asked, in an attempt to delay her hunger with conversation. "I thought you needed me to bring these items," and here she touched the pack containing her grandmother's ruby brooch, her book of wisdom, and the 'Song for a Dark Time,' "so what happened?"

Meldrake's answer came quickly. "I was as surprised as you were. The Silverbird, in addition to her station as the Queen of All of Lesser Birdkind, is a voyager of worlds. Some are like your own, and some are not. Please do also keep in mind that her kingdom encompasses all winged, feathered creatures save the Great Eagles Themselves and some species of dragons (which are a distant branch of the bird family, naturally)."

"The flicker and flash which our eyes perceive is but illusion: the Silverbird is ever-present, not only in this realm, but in others as well. She treads Space and Time as we do the needles of this humble path," he said with a flourishing gesture of his wing. "Though she is not all-knowing, her eye does see far. Very far indeed," he added, and his mood seemed at once to darken. "No, it is my belief that the items which you now carry cannot but reveal themselves and their purposes to you in time. You need only wait for that -- the Silverbird cannot help you with it. My dear Glynis, what troubles my mind is something which the good Queen herself told me, and it regards you."

Glynis was surprised. "What is it, Meldrake?" she asked. "I didn't even say ten words to her the whole time we were there."

John stopped walking altogether, his expression became more serious than usual. "Tell us what she said, Meldrake."

"Before I tell you, keep in mind what I've just said: the Silverbird travels among worlds. Times and places. The things she sees have all come to pass, or will, but not necessarily in this place. Do you understand this?" he asked.

Glynis and John each nodded in turn. By now, the little group had stopped, the better to hold their conversation in a quiet manner. In order to keep their business close, Meldrake stepped closer to the children, beckoning them to do the same.

"What the Silverbird has seen... it may come to pass in this world, and it may not. Nevertheless, I must tell you: Avis, she saw you clothed in red and black, reading from a great tome, leather-bound. You were surrounded by your fellows, children your own age, who themselves also wore robes of red and black. These are the colors of Redcloth's order."

Here Meldrake paused, looking into each of their eyes in turn.

"So," Glynis said, "she saw me with the children that were taken by Redcloth? Are you saying that I'm going to join Redcloth at some point? Is she saying that?"

"Not exactly," replied the raven. "It is a vision of the eyes -- no more and no less. You wore his robes, yes, but it may have been another you, in another place and time than this. There could be a reason for this: a warning, a portent, a plan. It is hard to say," Meldrake said.

"That may be, but you still look worried to me," said John to the raven. "But then again, I'm not an expert in the facial expressions of birds."

Meldrake softened at that. "Indeed not, my young friend, though I suppose you wouldn't be. Still, you've done well enough, for a poor flightless creature, that is," he said with a playful wink. "The thing to do now, it seems to me, is to visit a hermit, preferably one living in the mountains."

"A hermit?" asked Glynis.

"Oh yes," replied the raven. "We need to spend some time with a hermit on his mountain, and perhaps we can persuade him to share some of his great store of accumulated wisdom with us. Certainly he'll shore up deficiencies in our habits of mind!" Meldrake sounded genuinely excited about the prospect.

"I'm still not sure what that means," said Glynis, "but I'm willing to give it a try if it means helping the kids in Redcloth's clutches."

"Me too," added John.

"Wonderful, wonderful! We'll begin our journey right away. There's only the matter of deciding which hermit to bother, but I'm beginning to get an idea about that!"

Suddenly, Meldrake turned and began walking back the way they had just come. The children, for their part, followed him back in the direction of the sacred grove where they had only just met the Starling King and the Silverbird, away once more from the home of their new friend Kell, and growing further away with every step.

Some minutes later, they returned to that same grove which moments before had been filled with birds; now, it stood empty. They passed through it without comment, regaining the trail west-ward on the other side. A very few minutes after that, John was the first to hear the sounds of rushing water. Soon they all could hear it, and they continued towards the sound, which grew louder and louder. After what seemed to be about half a mile, they finally broke from the cover of the dark pine forest to which they had only just become accustomed (the children, that is -- for Meldrake seemed to be at his ease no matter where he was, or at least he made it seem so).

The three stepped out into the daylight, momentarily dazed by the bright glare after several hours spent in the woods. Even the grove of the Starling King had been dim compared to the open sky under which they now stood.

As for the trail, it continued down the embankment on which they stood, down through rocks and roots which traversed and molded the path itself, all the way to the water's edge. And what a sight it was! The river-sounds that had led them as they walked were now come fully to fore, the roar and rush of water over rock now filling their eyes as well as their ears. Though it ran about three hundred to five hundred feet wide by Glynis' reckoning, it was not deep, at least not where Meldrake and the children stood. It was, however, swift and filled with rocks and stones of all shapes and sizes, not to mention larger outcroppings of bedrock which poked forth their stony heads here and there, singly and in groups. These large formations created various small, foamy waterfalls, and chute-like passages which appeared made to fit small boats but which no doubt held hundreds of sharp rocks just below the surface; in short, it was a rough-and-tumbly environment filled with white water and rock, rapids if rapids ever there were.

"Meldrake, how are we all going to cross?" asked Glynis with a touch of apprehension. By now she knew that Meldrake had an answer for everything, even when he didn't, but she asked the question nonetheless.

"Follow me!" cried the raven, and he began to hop, skip and jump (rather strangely, the children thought) along the path down to the water's edge, stopping one hop short of landing in the river itself. As she arrived behind Meldrake, Glynis could see what he had been talking about. Set into the embankment, just off the trail, was a door, a wooden door with iron hinges. Next to it on either side were windows, little round ones. Some feet away, under a bundle of tree roots, was another round window -- and suddenly Glynis realized she was looking at a house. Before she knew it, Meldrake was swinging the brass knocker on the front door. Once, twice, three times he knocked before an answer came.

Or rather, an answer was there already. In his haste to rouse the inhabitants of this house-under-hillock, Meldrake had neglected to read the signs posted in several places about where he stood. Glynis, ever eager to please, informed him straightaway: "Meldrake, look at the sign!"

The raven promptly quit harassing the poor door-knocker and read the sign which sat patiently awaiting a reader. As was his wont, he read aloud:

"Dearest Guest,

In order that we may better serve the needs of the travelling public, this establishment is now closed.

Travelers are advised to please convey themselves to one of the nearby toll bridges, which are located in the villages of Greenfield and Halfmoon.

We apologize for any inconvenience.

Sincerely, The Holcredt Consortium"

Meldrake could hardly contain himself. "Tolls? Tolls? To cross our very own Long River, the same one we've been crossing since before time was time? What sort of madness, what hubris, what insane hatred toward one's fellows could drive the creation of such a scheme? I have never in my life heard of such things, save in tales of evil kings," he added.

Though she did not want to further Meldrake's ire, Glynis felt obligated to point out the obvious: "But Meldrake, you realize you don't have to pay, right? You're a bird, you can fly anywhere you please."

"That's just the sort of thinking that will end us all, Avis. 'Divide and Rule,' isn't that the ancient saying? No, this cannot be left as it is. Never in all my years of living has there been a toll put on those who crossed the Long River, and if I have my way about it, there won't be one for much longer." Meldrake turned and looked across the river, toward the forested hills beyond, shaking his great, black head. "Have we really bowed down at last to the money-grubbers?" he asked sadly.

Meldrake looked at those hills for a few moments more without speaking; when he turned around his face was hard, even to one who had little skill in reading avian features.

"We make for Halfmoon," was all he had to say.

* THE BADGER WHO STUDIED VERSE

At Meldrake's behest, the trio turned left, and southward, making their way to the bridge at Halfmoon. For the moment it seemed that all thoughts of visiting hermits and improving habits of mind had been set aside and indeed when John asked the raven what was to become of their trip to the hermit's lonely mountain, he received a single word in reply: "Later." Little did the great black bird or his young charges know how much later that visit would be.

So, Halfmoon it would be, and a very short hike along the river's edge was all it took to bring them within sight of the little walled town. In the meantime, the evergreen forests which had followed alongside the river as it made its way south fell away to the east, and were replaced by rolling hills and oak and maple trees. With the retreat of the evergreens, the soil became less rocky and sandy, more fertile -- and so our travelers three found themselves surrounded by farms. There were farms on both sides of the river, in fact, and tended pastures stretched for as far as human eyes could see in either direction, though undoubtedly a raven's eye could see farther, and its owner would claim as much in any case.

Thus our travelling friends arrived at the outskirts of the riverside village of Halfmoon, and were unpleasantly surprised by what they found there: a pair of sentries guarding the road into town, and no mere human sentries either. These formidable guards were a badger (he of the razor sharp teeth and claws) and a raptor of some kind, presumably a hawk (which comes with its own sharp edges, of course). In this way, the pair was able, if necessary, to engage in belligerence of the land- or airborne varieties. For his part, Meldrake (with John and Glynis in tow) afforded them all the respect and obeisance which it was his habit to give -- in short, none at all.

#+begin_verse
/Top of the morning, my road-blockers!/
/Crowd-flockers, Head-Knockers!/
/Is it fear you've come to bring/
/To the Populace on Foot and Wing?/
/Or would you, in your Kingly Grace/
/Permit we Humble Comm'ners pass your gates?/
#+end_verse

To the surprise of Meldrake, Glynis, and even the reticent John, the reply came sure and swift, delivered in the badger's throaty growl:

#+begin_verse
/Come now Raven, what's your game?/
/On foot, alone, strange children in tow?/
/O Trickster, won't you share your name?/
/We'll help you get where you're trying to go!/
#+end_verse

At that, Meldrake threw back his head and laughed. "A student of the Noble Verse, eh? And a badger, no less! I'd never have guessed."

The badger bowed, but only ever so slightly, as the hawk looked on, his great glassy eyes surveying the scene impassively. "At your service, Sir," the badger added in a tone that was not entirely unfriendly.

His partner the hawk was operating on different assumptions, however. "State your business in Halfmoon," he said coldly. Glynis looked from his beak to his claws and back again nervously. "/One quick slash of those talons/ . . .," she thought.

"What business does an honest creature need other than his own, here in the Protector's Realm?" asked Meldrake. "And who made you the Lord Arrogant Controller of these lands?"

"You'll state your business, or have none," replied the bird of prey.

"You must know well who you threaten, sir!" said Meldrake with a hearty laugh, and before Glynis knew what was happening, he was back on the offensive once more:

#+begin_verse
/Old Queen Mabb rules the World Below/
/a Byzantium with Gold Aglow;/
/Your dreams she holds in a Jewelled Case/
/Your fears? Another, secret place/
/Beneath what you thought was beneath before/
/A tunnel dug in the basement floor/
/And at its heart, an Iron Door/
/With hinges rusted, the passage Black/
/And it's where you stash those things you lack:/
/Compassion, Kindness, for a start --/
/Your frozen Eyes, and creaking Heart/
/Afraid to look within those places/
/Afraid of all the missing graces!/
/the ones you Ought, but don't Possess/
/The ones you've wronged, with no redress./

/So unless you want me delving there/
/Among your Secrets, Fears and Cares/
/And knowing all the times you Cheated/
/When by rights you should've been defeated/
/Then you'll have a care for what you say/
/When a kindly stranger comes your way/

/And since I haven't time to share full wrath/
/I'll demand that you simply *CLEAR MY PATH*!/
#+end_verse

At these last words of Meldrake's, there was a blinding flash as he flung open his great, black wings and drew himself to his full height. All the while he had been speaking, there had been a kind of energy building in the air around the group, a static which grew louder and louder as he went on; as he cried his final verse, something shot down from the sky overhead with a bang and struck the path before him. Glynis had no idea what had happened, it was all so rushed, but she found herself stunned and thrown off her feet just the same.

The blast knocked John down as well, along with the badger who'd studied verse. The hawk would not be defeated so easily, however. At the moment of impact, he stood his ground, smiling coldly. It was the smile of a hunter.

"You didn't think it'd be that easy, did you?" he asked in a quiet voice, reaching into the plumage at his chest to reveal a necklace woven with beads and charms.

"Ah, the Vermilion," said Meldrake, referring to one orange-red charm in particular. "For protection 'gainst Verse," he added for the benefit of the children (and you and I as well, no doubt! For who can say what a raven knows about who's listening in on his adventures?).

"Indeed," nodded the pale hawk. "My junior partner there has no such equipment -- I mostly keep him around to handle the drudge work."

Meldrake responded by wordlessly taking flight.

"Very well; to business, then," the hawk muttered, leaping into the air after Meldrake with his own frightening speed.

Meldrake knew that if it came down to a question of speed and strength, he'd lose, and quickly. Being a crafty old raven, however, he was not without resources. As he flew ever higher, he managed -- between flaps of his enormous wings, naturally -- to reach into a rough leather pouch tied to his midsection. It was, as you might guess, a /magical/ pouch. In fact, it served as a portal into the storeroom at the Ravenslair (which was the name of Meldrake's home and refuge, naturally). Thus he had instant access to any number of items which he might need, both common and not-so-common. He had only to say their names with the pouch open, and the requested item or items would be summoned from the shelves and racks of that far-away storeroom. In this way the raven was never truly very far from his home, or the comforts -- among them, weapons -- therein.

But enough digression -- the hawk gains quickly!

So it was, that when Meldrake opened the pouch at his belt, he whispered the words, "Staff of Forgetting," and the item by that name did appear. And what a Staff of Forgetting it was! Ramrod-straight, and carved of whitest ash, it was eighty inches tall if it were one. At its head perched a perfect sphere of no less than five inches in diameter, forged from the remnants of a falling star, or what we in our little corner of space and time would call a meteorite.

The hawk, pale and cold creature that he was, smiled to himself at the thought of an easy kill as he watched the larger, slower bird lose ground -- or air, in this case -- with every flap of the wing. He cruised easily past the raven on a higher trajectory, the better from which to launch a diving attack. As he soared above his prey, he surveyed the earth below: the great white mountains to the north, the lesser, greener mountains to the south, the hills and valleys between. "/How magnificent it is to be a hawk/," he thought. "/To have talon and beak and raw speed at your command/."

Just then, he noticed a white shape below him and to his left. It appeared to be a much smaller hawk, rising quickly. He thought it strange that a hawk, of all birds, should be such a pure white color -- indeed, he had never seen one quite like it before. He realized with a start that it was gaining on his position.

"/What's your business with me?/" he wondered to himself as the white hawk continued to climb. "No matter -- I'll deal with you later." He said this last aloud, just as he began his dive from a point high above Meldrake.

So down he went. Wings tucked at his sides, eyes reduced to slits, he bore down upon the poor, slow raven with frightening speed, his vision focused tightly on his target's neck, talons at the ready.

Alas, this narrow focus would be his undoing. As the hawk barreled downwards after his prey, the raven had managed to secure some weaponry of his own, namely: the inimitable Staff of Forgetting. And though Meldrake certainly did not possess hawk-like speed, he /could/ react and move quickly nonetheless, if he desired. And he /did/ so desire, for the death bearing down on him from above had put him in just such a mood as to look lively. Thus it was that just as the hawk was nearly upon him, Meldrake rolled of a sudden, and the great Staff of Forgetting with him, and O! How it sang as it cut through the air that day!

Glynis was not far off when it happened, and she heard the deadly song, heard the crack as metal met bone, and bone was found wanting. She saw the hawk's body transformed from a bullet, all clean, deadly purpose, into a lopsided pinwheel that spun all the way down to the ground below.

"Meldrake!" she had screamed seconds before, just as the hawk was nearing the end of its dive -- and its life, as it had turned out. She had not expected what came next -- not the death of the projectile-like hawk, and certainly not the /way/ it came, with the swift violence of Meldrake's swing.

Having dealt with his taloned pursuer, Meldrake turned to the white hawk that was, in fact, Glynis -- she had gained his position with a speed that surprised him. "Why Avis, you sneaky thing!" he cried. "There's simply no leaving you behind, is there?" He flew still holding the dread Staff of Forgetting, and as he spoke Glynis could see the crimson evidence of its exploits glistening in the sun. Glynis thought to ask the raven a question, something from the /what in Jelec's name do we do now?/ category, and realized that such a question would be of little use. There was only the reality in front of her to be dealt with, no matter how surreal it was. Besides, she had no doubt that the hawk she had just seen tumbling out of the sky would not have hesitated for even an instant, had their roles been reversed. And so it was what it was. She thought too that it could have had something to do with the avian body she now inhabited, this newfound acceptance of hers. Yes -- it was rather more difficult to be shocked by a confrontation between a 6-foot-tall staff-wielding raven and a magical-amulet-wearing, speaking hawk when you yourself have just shape-shifted from 12-year-old girl to bird of prey. Evidently, inhabiting -- indeed, becoming -- a hawk-mind will have profound effects on one's ways thinking, especially with regard to living, dying and the like. After all, it wasn't as if hawks were vegetarians.

So on they went, floating on the wind without any words, the newly-minted white hawk Avis and her formidable friend, the Versemaster Meldrake. They banked across the fields once more, high above the river and its commerce and cares. Glynis could see now that, south of Halfmoon, the river grew broad and calm, safe for boats carrying cargo to the north and south, though mostly to the south, presumably from the harvests of the many farms she could see below.

"/This world isn't so different from ours/," she thought. "/There may be badgers and ravens speaking in rhymes, but life has to go on: houses have to be built, food has to be grown, the sick have to be tended to. And sometimes people die/," she added to her own surprise, hardly recognizing that she had begun to think of the various creatures of Jelec's realm as people much like herself.

Now, of course, you may be wondering how it is that a young girl twelve years of age can go about seeing death, and transforming into two distinct species of birds -- predatory and non -- within the space of several days' time, and manage to be so calm and cool and equivocal about it all. Naturally, Necessity plays a part, since as every schoolchild knows She is the mother of Invention. There is also something to be said for the experience of a physical transformation itself, as any changes in the body will no doubt also be changes in the mind. There is no real difference between the two, you see: and in fact I would defy any and all skeptics to shift from human into, say, rabbit or osprey form for a few hours or even days, and then claim that they are, in fact, the same old lovable selves which they ever were. So it was with our Glynis.

As such, it was a rather calmer and more composed Glynis-hawk flying beside Meldrake that day. Perhaps her newfound comfort there in the White Bear's Realm grew from the confidence granted by speed, beak, and claw. If so, best not to question it -- for as our Glynis was beginning to learn from Meldrake's example, the hesitation of the questioner could mean death.

Meldrake broke into the reverie of these thoughts of Glynis' with his typical cheerful aplomb: "Well Avis, I think we'd best go and see about our friend on the ground. Since you've become so speedy all of a sudden, why don't you lead the way?" This last he added with an imp's tone and a wink.

"Ok," she replied, and banked hard to the right, knowing it would leave the larger, slower bird behind. She might have been concerned about finding her way back to where John was, but it turned out to be easy enough to simply follow the river from above. In no time at all, she was circling above the place of their meeting with the badger and hawk just moments before.

Once there, however, she decided it was better not to land.

It seemed that the badger, though he lacked the vermilion charm which would have protected him from Meldrake's Verse Magic, was nonetheless a stout creature, and had recovered quickly from being knocked unconscious to the ground. His first act after the blast was to secure his prisoner, the unfortunate John. His second act was to summon reinforcements. It was those reinforcements who now faced Glynis and Meldrake as they returned from their sortie against the decidedly unfriendly hawk (may his soul find Eternal Rest). They were seven or eight together, all badgers it seemed, probably relatives of the sentry who lived nearby.

These were preliminary observations made from a great height, of course. Even so, Glynis could not see her friend John anywhere among the group, and the panic which had begun in her mind upon seeing these creatures gathered here now took hold in earnest. "/Where is John??/" The words began to run on a loop in her head, and in her fear she lost her good judgment, and began descending towards the group of land-borne hostiles below. Just then she heard a "thunk" which reminded her of nothing so much as the sound a rubber band makes when you snap it between your fingers. This "thunk" was followed by a hissing sound, and seconds later Glynis saw, with her sharp new hawk's eyes, a tiny sliver of something travelling up to meet her at great speed. The first was followed by two more in quick succession before she realized: she was being shot at! The badgers now appeared to be holding long, thin tubes against their shoulders and were firing off darts!

"Avis! Climb, you fool! Those are darts, poison-tipped!" Thus came the call of Meldrake from high above the fray. Avis heard him and, realizing her life was in peril, turned away from her attackers and flew across the river where they could not follow, though she continued to hear the "thunk" of their dart guns as she fled, turning zigs and zags all the while to avoid their poisoned steel. Even as she did so, she wondered what had become of her friend quiet John. She hoped that he was alright, and that he had only been captured and not hurt.

Meanwhile, Meldrake the raven had been hard at work from his post high above Glynis Whitehawk's close encounter with the badger dart guns. Since there was little he could do to assist her in her escape by descending to her position (as he was the larger and slower of the two birds), his actions were these: first, he called to Avis his warning which, combined with her own realization of the danger, sent her swerving wildly across the river, and she was quickly out of range of their new enemies. In addition, Meldrake was also able, with the assistance of his magical pouch and storeroom, to procure several strangely heavy black spheres which he unceremoniously dumped on the creatures below, who, even though they saw the charges coming from quite a ways up, were still obliged by said charges to vacate the premises, and forthwith at that. This of course distracted them somewhat from their main project, viz. the dart attack on Glynis, long enough for her to move safely out of range.

Meldrake's second act was perhaps more valuable to their overall mission, which they had not defined as of yet, but which was spurred into clarity by the abduction of one Mr. John Sharp, friend of Glynis and now also nominally of the raven himself. The good Meldrake reached once more across and through the long miles to his storeroom and whispered for his "spyglass" -- at once, the item in question appeared. He was then able to note that several members of the hostile group below (who were hurrying along nicely back to Halfmoon, propelled, no doubt, by the several explosions at their backs) were wearing strips of red and black cloth about their arms, if arms are what badgers have.

"Damn and blast," said the raven to himself. "Blast and damn." He returned his spyglass to his pouch and turned to follow Avis across the river. He climbed another several hundred feet to err on the side of caution, should any other attackers present themselves. To his surprise, none did.

---

Glynis lay on her back with her eyes closed, her heart still racing from the narrow escape. Try as she might, she could not control the fear which gripped her chest. She couldn't seem to draw a full breath, and her quick and shallow breathing seemed to feed her panic. /Where is John? Is he alright?/ These were the only thoughts that seemed capable of expressing themselves in her agitated state, and they did so not once, or twice, but over and over again.

The frightening truth was that she had barely escaped with her life. This thought comforted her but little, and as she lay there in the grass at the meadow's edge, all she could think of was how to find her friend. His capture had shown her how truly vulnerable she was here, a young girl wandering in a place of dark magics, with sinister creatures on all sides, each waiting for its chance to capture her and put her to some sinister end or another.

As she lay there, she was no longer Avis the White Hawk, creature of speed and talon, but Glynis the girl, who has lost her only friend to the darkness.

"/I wish I had never come to this place/." She thought it, but dared not say it, for she began to understand the power of words in this place. She could not risk returning home while her friend remained, nor was she inclined to give up so easily her newfound life as a hawk, though John's capture had obviously removed some of its lustre at the moment.

It was at that moment that she remembered her trusty backpack, for the first time in quite a while. In the course of her landing and subsequent transformation back to human form, she had simply thrown the red nylon bookbag to the ground, flinging herself down along with it. Now, as it lay there in the long grass, her mind turned to its contents, and before she knew it, she had pulled the dog-eared paperback free. Her hands knew the page they sought, and what her eyes found there...

---

"They wore cloths of red and black."

Meldrake gave his report to Glynis just as he found her, with no preamble. She had been lying in the grass with her eyes closed.

Glynis opened her eyes. "Yes, I saw it too. What does it mean, Meldrake?"

"I'm not sure yet -- or I'm not sure I like what it means, especially for you and I, Avis. Since we have seen those colors before. Twice now, in fact."

"Most recently on that sign posted by the abandoned river crossing. The 'Holcredt Consortium,' right?"

"Indeed," said the raven. "It seems this 'consortium' has consolidated a fair amount of power in the region in a relatively short time."

"What is it anyway?" asked Glynis. "The Holcredt Consortium, I mean."

"A good question. After our little encounter today, I have my own fair ideas about what it is, but first I'd like you to answer a question for me."

"Alright," replied Glynis.

"How many different ways are there to arrange the letters in 'Holcredt'?"

"I don't know. Lots, I'd imagine."

"Well, that's no way to approach a problem," said the raven quietly.

"Meldrake, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm a little more worried about finding John right now than I am about some math problem."

"This *is* about finding John," replied Meldrake. "You don't think we're just going to fly around blindly /looking/, do you? That is a fool's errand. There are but two of us, and it's blind luck that the party we did encounter had no birds of prey with them, or we'd be with John... or worse, /dead/."

"You had no problem with that hawk we ran into," said Glynis.

"That hawk was barely hatched, a mere `boy' in your terms, and a lowly sentry assigned to a minor village's outskirts to boot. And I barely escaped with my feathers attached. I am no warrior, fast and strong -- I am an old raven with creaky wings and a few nonsensical rhymes and tricks! Can you not see how lucky we were?" This last was a cry of near-exasperation, as if Meldrake could scant believe Glynis' ignorance of their true situation.

Glynis sensed his frustration. It was true that she hadn't realized until just now what sort of danger they were in. She had thought Meldrake possessed of some sort of infallible magic, what with the way he always seemed to know where to go and what to say to whom. "/Perhaps he is more capable than he thinks/?" she wondered. In any case, they were joined in this venture come what would, and she decided it was best to contribute however she could.

With a small sigh, Glynis shrugged her shoulders, and in her best conciliatory tone said: "Explain to me how answering this problem will help me find John."

"It may not, to be honest. I have a few good ideas about where he might be, and with whom, but there is much work in front of us if we are to attempt such a rescue."

"You think it's Redcloth."

"I do," replied Meldrake.

"It's pretty obvious where the letters in HOLCREDT come from," said Glynis. "Even to me, and I'm not the best at word puzzles."

"Still, as an exercise . . . keep in mind that it will be very important to develop these habits of mind -- and others we have yet to speak of -- in order that we are ready when the time comes. This enemy is a lover of all manner of tricks and games, puzzles and mazes. Were we to meet him in his own strongholds as we are now, we would perish. We must grow stronger before we can hope to rescue your friend. Therefore: I ask you again, how many ways can you arrange the letters in HOLCREDT?"

Glynis had to admit that her schooling thus far had not prepared her to answer such questions.

"Oh, but it has!" exclaimed the raven Meldrake. "You just don't realize it."

"How is that?" asked Glynis.

"No explanations, young lady," Meldrake replied with mock sternness. "First, we work the problem. And the way to commence is the same way we discover anything new: we ask questions. First question: how many letters are in HOLCREDT?"

"That's easy," replied Glynis. "Eight. But I don't see how to get from there to the answer."

"My dear Avis, when you leave your house to visit a friend, do you aim your body in the direction of their abode and cover the distance in a single leap?"

Glynis shook her head no. Meldrake's question made her think instantly of her friend John, of course, and her eyes began to fill with tears. The daughter of a stern and strong mother, this was not something she was accustomed to.

"There, there. Please don't cry my dear." To both their surprise, Meldrake came and enfolded Glynis in a scraggly black wing.

"We will find him, you know," said the raven. "Most likely he is simply being used as a lure to ensnare one or both of us, or perhaps even the Queen Silverbird herself, if our enemy believes she will come to our aid. In such a case it would do them no good to harm him, and in fact I do believe we can count on seeing him again in the not-terribly-distant future."

With that, he released Glynis and was once again his old vexing self. "So we can see that there are eight letters," he said, as if nothing had interrupted them.

* A SIMPLE RECIPE

"The question, then," said Meldrake, "is this: how do we find out how many different combinations can be made from those eight letters?"

"Well, I still don't know how to find out," replied Glynis. "Maybe we can find out for a smaller number, but eight seems like too many. It would take too long," she added.

Meldrake studied Glynis with a look she didn't understand (most likely because the facial expressions of birds are notoriously difficult to read, as we've already noted). It was in fact a look of disbelief.

"So you've stumbled upon Rule Four," he said.

"I suppose I have." Glynis played along. After all, one can't always be asking for explanations!

"Just the same, I'll state it in full, for the record: Given a problem P which the practitioner has no method for, propose an alternative problem P' ("p-prime") such that P' is a simpler case of P."

Glynis' eyebrows went up a bit, but she said nothing.

"Or in the common speech, though less precise: `Solve an easier version of the same problem.' As you've just said, there are many ways to arrange eight letters, or eight items of any kind, for that matter. Perhaps we'd do better to begin with a more manageable number. Would you care to suggest one?" he added with mock nonchalance.

"One it is," replied Glynis oh-so-cleverly.

"Your wish is my command." With a flourish, Meldrake reached into the trusty magical pouch he kept tied to his belt for such occasions, and whispered a word in a tongue which Glynis did not recognize. An instant later, he withdrew a velvet pouch. With a slight clacking sound he withdrew a single white stone, and turned once again to his friend. He then proceeded to stomp out a space in the meadow grass within which to work, at last placing the single stone in one corner:

[Figure 10.0].
[[./img/10.0.jpg]]

"Clearly you've chosen an easy case," said Meldrake. "Let's add another."

Once again the clacking of the stones inside the pouch was heard as Meldrake withdrew a second white stone and placed it gently on the flattened grass:

[Figure 10.1].
[[./img/10.1.jpg]]

"Two." Glynis said it before the raven could ask. "These are pretty easy so far," she added.

With a whisper, Meldrake withdrew yet another item from the leather pouch at his belt, this one clearly a writing implement of some kind.

Glynis saw the need for it instantly. "Yes, we'll definitely need that as we keep going up," she said.

Meldrake withdrew a third stone and placed it next to the other two. He then marked each stone with his long pen so that they looked like this:

[Figure 10.2].
[[./img/10.2.jpg]]

Withdrawing a sheet of coarse paper from his pouch, he handed pen and paper to Glynis. "Keep the count, if you please," he said.

Glynis accepted. "This is combination #1," she added, as she made a small mark on the yellow paper.

Meldrake moved the stones again, and the result:

[Figure 10.3]
[[./img/10.3.jpg]]

This Glynis dutifully recorded with a second mark on the paper, and nodded for him to continue.

[Figure 10.4]
[[./img/10.4.jpg]]

After that, Meldrake had only to move the stones into a new ordering, and Glynis recorded the same.

A moment later, all was said and done, and Glynis and Meldrake had seen the following combinations (some of which we've already seen, but we shall leave this as a reference):

[Figure 10.5]
[[./img/10.5.jpg]]

| 1,2,3 | 1,3,2 | 2,3,1 | 2,1,3 | 3,1,2 | 3,2,1 |

"As you can see from your own meticulously-kept record of events, my dear Avis, there are six combinations of these three humble stones."  So Meldrake continued with his delightful habit of summing up the obvious. "Shall we try four?" he asked, reaching once more into the velvet pouch which held the white stones.

"I think I'm beginning to see the pattern, but I'd like to see another round to be sure," replied Glynis.

"Why certainly!" was the reply from the ever-helpful Meldrake. "Be at the ready with the stylus."

And so the raven marked a fourth stone, and arranged the stones in their various combinations as before, and they were thus:

[Figure 10.6]
[[./img/10.6.jpg]]

| 1,2,3,4 | 1,3,2,4 | 1,3,4,2 | 1,2,4,3 | 1,4,3,2 | 1,4,2,3 |
| 2,1,3,4 | 2,3,1,4 | 2,4,1,3 | 2,1,4,3 | 2,3,4,1 | 2,4,3,1 |
| 3,1,2,4 | 3,1,4,2 | 3,2,1,4 | 3,2,4,1 | 3,4,1,2 | 3,4,2,1 |

| The Fourth Arrangement is left as an Exercise for the Reader |

"Wow," said Glynis. "That was not entirely what I'd expected. I could barely fit it all on the page," she added, showing it to Meldrake.

"Are you able to see the pattern?" asked the raven.

"Take a few moments and look only at the pattern," said Meldrake as he handed the sheet of paper back to Glynis. "Do not try to find the `solution;' just test a few patterns in your mind using the numbers available to you."

Glynis examined the paper again, her brow knitted in concentration. Certainly nothing in her experience at the Lake William Schoolhouse had prepared her in any explicit way for this sort of task; her teachers, though earnest and diligent, had presented mathematics to the children as a series of recipes of the kind one might find written on the side of a box of dried pasta, which is to say: ingredients you put together on the stovetop without understanding the resulting meal.

"I don't know," replied Glynis. "Let me take another look at what we've got so far." She began writing as she spoke: "One stone has one combination. Two, two. Three, six. And four? Twenty-four. I still don't have it. Maybe we can do another one? No, that would be much too big, I think," she added after a half-second's pause.

"May I see that paper? I'd like to try writing it for you in another way," said the raven. He took the paper and stylus from Glynis, and where she had written the number of stones and their corresponding combinations using one column each, he added a third column, so that the result looked like this:

[Figure 10.7]
[[./img/10.7.jpg]]

| 1 |  1 | 1          |
| 2 |  2 | 1, 2       |
| 3 |  6 | 1, 2, 3    |
| 4 | 24 | 1, 2, 3, 4 |

"/Even so/," thought Glynis, "/what are recipes if not patterns? Ways of doing things to get a certain result, like a chicken pot pie. So the question is: how do I make this particular chicken pot pie/?"

Glynis took up the stylus and, in an empty corner of the backside of her single sheet, wrote this little chart:

[Figure 10.8]
[[./img/10.8.jpg]]

| "Ingredients" | "Instructions" | "Chicken Pot Pie" |
| 1             |                | 1                 |
| 2             |                | 2                 |
| 3             |                | 6                 |
| 4             |                | 24                |

Peering down each column of numbers, she wondered how to write the recipe. "/Since I don't understand the whole thing yet/," she thought, "/I'll just write the instructions to get from one number to the next/."

[Figure 10.9]
[[./img/10.9.jpg]]

| "Ingredients" | "Instructions" | "Chicken Pot Pie" |
|             1 | Do nothing     |                 1 |
|             2 | Do nothing     |                 2 |
|             3 | Multiply by 2  |                 6 |
|             4 | Multiply by 6  |                24 |

"Aha!" she said to herself as she wrote. She saw the pattern as clear as day: in each case, one need only multiply the number on the left by the number one line up on the right, e.g.,

[Figure 10.10]
[[./img/10.10.jpg]]

| 1 |          |   1 |
| 2 | Times 1  |   2 |
| 3 | Times 2  |   6 |
| 4 | Times 6  |  24 |
| 5 | Times 24 | 120 |

"I have it, Meldrake! Look!" she cried in triumph, grinning broadly as she showed Meldrake the scribbles which contained the answer, or at least the road leading to it.

"You've got it, Avis. Very nice work there, very nice! You've uncovered the mechanics of the operation, its bones, if you will. The rest is simply application, which is nearly a triviality best left as an exercise for the reader, I'm afraid. Nonetheless, can you extend your results to answer the question at hand?" All this Meldrake said in a voice that could scarce contain his delight, so filled with joy was he at his pupil revealing an insight of her own. It was, he hoped, a precursor of more to come.

"Well, according to my chart, if we were to add another stone to our current total, we'd have five times twenty-four, which is . . ." (and here Glynis returned to her worksheet to perform the relevant calculation) ". . . one hundred and twenty combinations! It's a good thing, we stopped doing everything by hand just when we did, Meldrake."

"Yes it is," replied the raven. "I'm afraid I'm much too lazy to do all of that shifting-stones-around business. Though of course," he added, "true laziness is one of the Numbermaster's Great Virtues. Laziness, and the unwillingness to keep doing the same work over and over again, is what drives one to seek out a general solution. As such, you can see that we still have a bit further to go before we can call this problem solved."

"You wanted to know how many combinations of letters can be made from H-O-L-C-R-E-D-T. There are eight letters, and we know that with five letters, there would be one hundred and twenty combinations," said Glynis.

"Go on."

Glynis returned to her worksheet, which was by now so covered in marks that she was forced to resort to making tiny marks along the margins that were in fact very much like these:

[Figure 10.11]
[[./img/10.11.jpg]]

| 1 |      1 | 1 x 1                 |
| 2 |      2 | 2 x 1                 |
| 3 |      6 | 3 x 2                 |
| 4 |     24 | 4 x 6                 |
| 5 |    120 | (5 x 20) + (5 x 4)    |
| 6 |    720 | (6 x 100) + (6 x 20)  |
| 7 |   5040 | (7 x 700) + (7 x 20)  |
| 8 | 40,320 | (8 x 5000) + (8 x 40) |

(As it turned out, Glynis was quite good at multiplications involving largish numbers, thanks to her teachers' rigorous schedule of drills. This marked the first time she'd used it to solve a problem where the need for multiplication wasn't baldly obvious to her.)

"40,320," was Glynis' response post-scribbling. "That is the answer."

"Yes, that sounds about right," replied the raven. "Forty-thousand combinations, and this from only eight items, which in this case, are letters. Imagine instead we were faced with dozens of items to choose from, such as this: You are presented with a glass jar, and placed before a great hall, one with many doors. All of the doors are locked, and inside the jar are hundreds of small keys. Your adversary --"

"Meldrake!"

"Yes, Avis?"

"No more riddles for today, please."

"Well, I should say that these are hardly riddles, my dear Avis! They are in fact just the sorts of Problems which the Numbermaster is faced with on any given day of his life. Nonetheless, your point is well-taken. Perhaps it is time we were off, anyhow."

"Off to where?" asked Glynis.

"Grant me my mysteries! Poke, prod, and question as you will, but grant me my mysteries. Besides which, you shall know soon enough, since it is you who must carry yourself there, under your own wing's power," said Meldrake.

"We're flying, then," said Glynis (more to herself than Meldrake) in a matter-of-fact sort of way, a manner that might have surprised an earlier, earth-bound Glynis.

"Indeed," replied the raven Meldrake. "We haven't time for any more of this `let's stroll about the countryside taking our time and smelling the flowers whilst ouxr Adversary gathers his forces' business. Though it is a nice business to be in, if one has the time," he added.

And with that Meldrake unfurled his great, shaggy wings from his equally shaggy body, and began his ungainly run across the meadow they had been resting in. This run was one Glynis hadn't seen before, though it was clearly a way in which to gather speed for takeoff.

And so Meldrake did take off, and his wings held him up, as they had so many times before, and in fact they carried him rather nicely for a bird of his size, Glynis thought.

It was then that she realized that the black creature which was the raven was now becoming a mere dot against the sky, something very far away indeed. Thus she looked to her own bones and asked them once more to lengthen and grow hollow, and she asked her flesh to sprout its feathers, and it did that too, until she was in fact once again Avis Whitehawk. She leapt into the air after Meldrake with all the urgency of one who is being left behind.

/Here ends the first part of the story of Jelec, which is to say the story of Glynis-who-became-Avis and her discovery of, and adventures within, the Realm of the White Bear./

* INTERLUDE: THE KING'S DREAM

As the white bear slept, the seasons turned. Over and over he rolled, stirring for a moment here or there. Now and again he would absently paw at the air, a rumbling deep in his chest, a distant thunder before the lightning's strike. Through it all, he dreamed.

And what dreams were these, the dreams of a being imbued with such might as to command the awe of even the redoubtable Meldrake?  We cannot say. Perhaps they were kingly dreams, such as could raise even the paw of the Protector from its rest -- dreams of battles that would shake the very earth.

Then again, who are we to wonder what dreams lurk in the hearts of kings? And would we recognize what we found there, even were it given to us to know such things?

Surely, we would like to believe, as all men do, that the heart of the King is no different than our own, filled with the same hopes, haunted by the same fears, and that the King's mind, distant though it may be from our own, can be known.

The truth, however, requires us to travel into and through some rather darker places, and deeper, too . . .
