Twelve-year-old Glynis McGinty works in the laundry room at a Victorian-era hotel near her home in the mountains. One day, she discovers a stained glass door decorated with a strange motif, and an even stranger appeal. On the other side of that door are Meldrake the Raven and his various friends, enemies, and more. They are all inhabitants of a world rather like our own, both magical and measurable, where bears and ravens speak in their own secret tongues and live in towns and cities of their own making. Over them all falls the shadow of Jelec, the White Bear, the Protector, who is not so much a bear as a Force of Nature (or of Magic itself, which is the same thing).
